Here I keep track of small projects that I am doing to play with data, learn/pracice algorithms/topics  

**Random Forest**

[**Grocery.ipynb**](https://github.com/DRMRK/Machine_Learning-/blob/master/Grocery.ipynb) Data from Kaggle Favorita competetion, I follow approach outlined by fastai (Jeremy Howard). Topics explored: equivalent of SQL joins in pandas, deal with large datasets, dealt with missing/categorical values, date time format.   

[**Airline_data_analysis**](https://github.com/DRMRK/Machine_Learning-/blob/master/Airline_data_analysis.ipynb) Data downloded from Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Exploratory analysis.Can we predict flight delay using available data ?
