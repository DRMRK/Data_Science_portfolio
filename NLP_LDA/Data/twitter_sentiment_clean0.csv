@TransLink I found a wallet left on the left side rear wheel seat of the EB 601 number R9279. I alerted the driver but I thought I'd let y'all know someone might be missing a wallet out there
@TransLink @Sethrogen Sorry friends no can do
Look at this monstrosity. Please don't ever do anything remotely like this in BC. @BCGreens @bcndp @TransLink @TranBC
"I thought the whole thing about @car2goVancouver cars being stowed in locked underground parking garages downtown was a bit of an urban myth, but after “arriving” at two locations (near parkades) with no cars in sight, I’m a believer. At least @TransLink arrives. #takinthebus"
"@AMacNewWest @BCGreens @bcndp @TransLink @TranBC It's just a diverging diamond interchange. With your mindset, no wonder Metro Van such a traffic clusterf***. Hell, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, &amp; Montreal years ahead of us. Obvious ya don't understand highway design/standards."
@Shelbiean @TransLink It means the cds have the ride on them
@TransLink Check out this huge SkyTrain map I made! 
@pixelart2051 @Shelbiean @TransLink If you watch the video it will make sense 
Thanks @TransLink but I actually gave up waiting.  There are a few other grumpy commuters still waiting for 19 bus though  heading eastward (or at least trying) on Kingsway at e12
@gurdipsahota @MetroVancouver @CityofVancouver @DisabAllianceBC @JDyson @TransLink @TranBC @gurdipsahota It has nothing to do with Ask-Listen-Act program. It is lack of service. There are three more cab companies with accessible taxis in Vancouver. Bigger is not always better
"@TransLink Yes, thank you!"
@pixelart2051 @TransLink ahhh cool!
@TransLink Transit alerts online is fixed 
Buses stuck on Lions Gate. Take alternate route. Emergency vehicles on bridge blocking traffic @TransLink @NEWS1130Traffic
Be great if you let folks know to take Seabus and avoid the 240 @TransLink as buses are not going anywhere on bridge

Ya hey @TransLink where is the 171 Fremont. Didnt show up at coquitlam station
@TransLink Maybe then TransLinkshould re-plan at the schedule if they are aware of it? Its always the traffic down at the Pinetree Elementary school in the morning that caused the delay.
@TransLink Why does the 22 Knight NOT STOP passed 30th Avenue ( 8am) when there's so much space at the back? It's extremely inconvenient that I have 2 wait 30 plus minutes for a bus when nd I see over 4 buses passing by without stopping. How inconvenient.
@TransLink are you guys aware of this?

@TransLink #translink @TransLink better service on the 319 doesn’t mean pressure your drivers to be dangerous and take chances. When it gets wet it’s going to mean people are falling on the bus those who stand don’t have seat belts... and that’s the least of the worries the way he drives
"@TransLink #translink @TransLink just like those forms, nothing will be done. All this press about how your drivers are protecting your passengers. If they knew the full extent to how bad the service was from an insider... stop hiring trash drivers and property maintain your equipment"
@TransLink I think what it will take is me getting a GoPro and videoing the crazy stuff and sending it to @GlobalBC maybe then you will investigate and make a change? I doubt it tho. Still well over safe capacity during night service.
"@TransLink Yes, it was an attendant. I walked off a fully-functioning train down the (broken) escalator to where he was preventing a massive crowd of people from going up, well after your announcement that trains were moving again."
"@TransLink And to clarify, this was not crowd control - he was standing at the foot of the escalator preventing anyone from going up it."
@TransLink :(
@TransLink Your Damn bus WB 30(stop #55575) didn't showed up i have been standing here for 20 minutes now the bus should have been here 11 minutes ago and i have exam in an hour.
"@taqforcouncil @GRSJInstitute Everyone would like a SkyTrain to their place of employment, however, given larger regional traffic problems, it’s hard to see how this could be a @TransLink priority."
@TransLink   Why is it so difficult to keep up escalator at Main st working. Can’t count frequency of service or malfunction
"@HaneyInkslinger @GRSJInstitute @TransLink Approximately 70,000 people work or study at UBC. That’s more than 10% of the city’s population and doesn’t include the number of visitors that come for conferences and events. It’s pretty clear to me that #skytraintoUBC is a priority."
Do you think your city is #Readyfor100?
"@TransLink why can't I, as a tourist, purchase an unlimited use 7, 10, or 14 day transit pass at the machines to use while visiting Vancouver? I had to buy a day pass at over $10, which is a total rip. I can get around for a week on that where I live."
"@TransLink Sorry that was bad decision on your part, the Station was jammed with stranded passengers and all subsequent trains were full as well, since they all had to accommodate the passengers from the trains that was take out of service earlier,"
@TransLink who thought it was good idea to take a train heading downtown during rush hour traffic to make up for a shortage heading other direction against the rush hour commuters?
@TransLink And what of any unused balance?
Figures. Wearing shirt and tie so the bus driver opens vent and turns off air conditioner. Sauna on the 351 @TransLink
I work in the transit industry so when visiting another city it's a no-brainer to take #publictransit. YVR Skytrain is so easy to use @TransLink

@TransLink we have been waiting for the 251 Queens for more than 10 minutes and it hasn’t showed up and your website says it is departing now. What’s the deal with that? Is the bus coming or should we wait ONE HOUR for the next one? This is unacceptable.

@TransLink 17 Downtown bus from Marine Drive station has missed two runs. Is it cancelled? I looked at the site and also sent a message via SMS but nothing on there.
"@TransLink Exactly 15 minutes!
Can the people who waited apply for credit of some sort? We all pay a hundred a month, and delays like these feel like I'm paying for half a service."
"@TransLink I'd understand if it were one bus, but this was like three. How unfortunate."
@TransLink wondering if I can get some info on what's going on with the 128 heading westbound. I take it from 12th street everyday after work but on Friday aswell as today I've ended up walking all the way to 22nd street station because it hasn't shown up.
"Good news if you live close to the #skytrain! @TransLink  #CityofVancouver 

 "
"@TransLink Was waiting around 5pm. Strange that if it was on time that I didn't see one pass the entire time I was walking down 8th avenue. Friday I was waiting 5pm aswell, waited 20 minutes then proceeded to begin my walk. The whole time I never saw one pass."

"@TransLink there is a slippery liquid that spilt on the entrance of Surrey Central Station. I tried to avoid it but even the ""clean"" areas are still slippery. I actually slipped. My ankle is now hurting. Please have this cleaned up immediately. #Skytrain"

"@TransLink Another day, another huge line at UBC Bay 8 for the evening #25 bus.  How about adding some more buses?"
@Translink what is the expected number of 99s that will pass you by before you can catch a bus at this time of day. Asking for a me. Current count is 4.
First night taking public transit in over 6 months and here we are sitting in the cold cus the bus is late. @TransLink
"@TransLink there are 11 lights out at marine drive station. This is a real safety issue, not even for crime, but for people simply walking. "
@TransLink This is a common problem too at most of the outdoor CL stations.
@CTVVancouver @mayors_council @TransLink @bcndp wonder why people don’t take transit. Until there is actually security that can do something and consequences fit to deter this behaviour I will NEVER take transit. If someone did that to me they would be taking the offender off bus in a bag.
@macdaley360 @TransLink I was trying to get home with my stroller bound toddler and my 7 yr old.. bike trailer would have been preferred.
"Hey @TransLink, could you turn the heat down on the 99? It’s 9 degrees outside, not -100. Thnx love u."
"@j_mcelroy He's got a point, the recent @TransLink estimate at $2.9 billion was stated in year-of-expenditure dollars (2022) and included a large 25% contingency on much of construction. @SkyTrain4Surrey called this out and we believe those costs are very overstated. "
"Hayne points out that on LRT/SkyTrain issue: This is not up to the mayor. If there's going to be a change, that has to be decision at @TransLink mayors' council. Gill adds business plan will not support cost of a SkyTrain. #surreyelxn2018"
"What the f*** @TransLink I'm standing AT THE BUS STOP SIGN 51480 and both a 41 and 43 drove right up, swerved over like they were going to stop, then just continued on their merry way. Do your f***ing jobs. 20:35 Oct 9"
"@matthewdesteur @CTVVancouver @mayors_council @TransLink @bcndp Many of us take it as we have no vehicle to get around, etc.  Handidart won't take disabled bus pass only tickets.

@LittleDove0 @CTVVancouver @mayors_council @TransLink @bcndp Super scary. Another reason why we simply need #ridesharing to give more options until the loony tunes are dealt with adequately and managed proactively.

"A 4 bus 99 wait this morning, because none of us actually wanted to be on time for work. Will @TransLink bother to do something about the impossibility of getting on a bus after Commercial but before Cambie before the next giant developments open? We all know the answer is no."
@TransLink It eventually let people out. The digital board said “train not stopping” but everyone boarded and it went the correct direction. Some glitch maybe.
@TransLink Thanks hope he is ok.
@TransLink what’s the delay on expo line heading eastbound.  Been waiting for a while.
@TransLink What is happening on the Expo line this morning? I waited at Burrard station for easily 10-15 minutes for a train and 2 trains passed by without stopping before a train stopped. No advisory anywhere.
A study suggests #SkyTrain noise is as loud as 90 decibels in some stretches. That's about as loud as a large commercial airliner preparing to land. @TransLink is looking at ways to reduce the noise  
"@TransLink Not good enough! My boss is going to want to know why I'm late, I can't just shrug my shoulders! Normally there is a train every minute or two, so there is, by comparison, a MASSIVE delay somewhere. Please investigate."
@NEWS1130 @TransLink Two words: baby oil
"@TransLink hey, how come my credit card works for putting money on my compass card, but is declined when I use the same card to try and set up auto refill?"
@TransLink I was travelling from Burrard to Commercial-Broadway. I arrived at the station at approximately 8:40 and finally got on a train at 8:55. Only 2 trains passed by before the third train that I boarded.
@TransLink The message on the station announcement board and on the trains were all that the train was not stopping for those two.

"Oh @TransLink. Why is the sky train so full so late in the commute? Got on at New West, already packed. Then ppl at Edmonds couldn’t get on."
@TransLink No doubt. Is this what public transit is like in Japan where they hire people to push everyone onto the train?

@TransLink again a bus won’t let passengers in because it’s running late? Or some such reason? Stop 50610 - it stopped long enough to let a wheelchair off but staff actively stood at the door telling us not to get on.
@TransLink Thanks must be bad I’ve been here since 433 and one just coming now
@TransLink That bus was full and didn’t stop! The sign says we added more service .... :( sadly I’m usually home in new west by now
@TransLink There are stop changes in effect because of construction at Canada post building. I’m wondering where to catch the bus now instead of on Hamilton (I work in gastown)?
@TransLink why did the 502 just pass stop #59705 I was waiting and it just went pasted me
"@TransLink bus 7313 bypassed stop 51398 without stopping, less than 50% full. No busses for almost 30 minutes. What is wrong with the 123"
When all you wanna do is go home but @TransLink has other plans....
@TransLink I don’t understand why my stored value keeps decreasing when I have a monthly pass and only take the Canada line. Why is the system always trying to screw us and charge extra?
"@TransLink The point is every time a bus does not stop, minutes are lost. A minute where your train has departed. A minute later your connecting bus has already left. Then you get to wait twenty minutes for the next bus. Do you think we ride merely for the experience?"
@TransLink I got on bus 16018 after being at the stop for about 40 minutes
"@TransLink Just saw 7313 going the other way, this time with a ""full"" sign... There are still seats and no one standing"
@TransLink Re; New bus route from  UBC Surrey Why not swing by Surrey Memorial so straff and students can get out there?
How can 5 123 New West busses go by and not one 123 Brentwood come in the last 50 minutes.... @TransLink
I went to templeton today and THATS NOT EVEN THE AIRPORT but coming back I was still charged 8$ FOR USING THE TRAIN. LITERALLY A MAJOR SCAM wtf @TransLink are you SERIOUS I’m gonna cry?

@JWolber @TransLink 15 business days for a reply. It’s almost like @TransLink makes the feedback process so long and painful people just give up. 
"Hey @TransLink: ever consider running more 351s or extending the run times for 352 and 354 on weekday evenings from Bridgeport? This line in front could not fit on the 7pm bus, and the lengthy line behind me will likely not make it on until at least 7:30. Clearly there is demand! "

"@TransLink Thank you for the reply! I will certainly fill out the feedback form, and hope to see those double deckers soon!"
@TransLink what is going on with the 351 Bridgeport to white rock?! Have you seen the queue?! Any chance you could put on more buses?
"@TransLink @JWolber Hopefully that makes a meaningful difference, but sounds like too little, too late."
"@cjmil @TransLink @JWolber I’ve been “leaving feedback” about this service for months, and all that happened was they cut the 351 service at night. I don’t want to leave more in case they punish us expendables more"
Cool.  I can't report a problem driver to @TransLink  because they didn't even number this bus.  Awesome.

"Glad to see @TransLink looking into what is an important livability issue. 
"
"Living within earshot of the Expo Line, this definitely matters - and hopefully this might also improve things inside the train as well."
@TransLink I'm sorry why on earth do you consistently raise prices for people who ACTUALLY LIVE IN VANCOUVER when all you do is add more trains for people who don't even live in Vancouver
@TransLink THEN you do track repair and make us wait forever. If you know that your services are not up to what you promised when the ticket is purchased there should be some sort of refund or discount.
@TransLink I understand track maintenance is necessary but whether it takes a day or a fucking year I could care less just don't make people who pay money for a service suffer because your workers don't want to work as many nights
@timcbarton @TransLink Put one of these in each skytrain car. Boom! ??? 
"@TransLink I saw that you want reports of loud sections of SkyTrain track: I'd like to report the area around Gilmore Station, particularly the corner that happens right before the station on the west side (above the Home Depot) is quite loud."

What’s the safety plan if the Seabus has issues @TransLink - im going out the window it seems ?????? 
@CA_WetCoast @TransLink Must have been a schedule mistake. The 262 at that time goes to Caulfeild still and driver has 20 minute break while a 250 turns into a 259 (previously a 257 did this) and that bus heads to Lions Bay but not Brunswick
@TransLink why is it cold in the expoline train? Its cold outside you know..
@TransLink @ultramotif There is no 262 to Lions Bay at that time. Service is provided by the 259 to Lions Bay at that time from Horseshoe Bay. 259 is a big bus and unfortunately a lot expect to look for the shuttle and not a big bus

"@TransLink Sorry, my question was supposed to be ""without the u-pass: if I have (for example) $0.10 on my card and I board the bus, does it deduct the fare and put me in the negative, or does it decline the transaction?"""
"What time does the next 157 come on stop 53388? Text says 944, transit app says 10:13 @TransLink"
"@TransLink Well if google maps can update their app in real time, then maybe I suggest a better network and some real time updating servers? But maybe not because I can't even imagine what you'd hike the prices to. Maybe I should just start driving...every day its something with you guys."
@TransLink Can I expect it at that stop at 9:44 then or is it gonna be late
"@TransLink Ok. How does fare go negative, then? It ended up that that was why I had trouble yesterday."
@TransLink Yeah I'll do that and nothing will happen so why bother??? So I'll just keep on being a very unhappy customer for now. Thanks though.

@TransLink @UBC Maybe you might be able to shed insight? I mean... the article says right there it's with @TransLink so... I'm confused.
Attn: #CompassCard users on @TransLink... does your monthly pass card ever randomly have a -1.50 balance on it? That counts as insufficient fare? Legit happens to me every few months randomly.
@TransLink what is wrong with the 319. Been waiting 20 minutes at 90 &amp; Scott. One bus just passed completely full.
@TransLink No bus at 7.36. The 7.52 bus just got here. Thanks!
@TransLink question. Im at Edmonds station and purchased a single zone card. Come to realize I need 2 zones. I upgraded and paid 1.25. same thing leaving Coquitlam but I had to upgrade 2.75. why the huge difference to add on single zone? Thanks ?
Look! @WeWork is coming to @MarineGateway ?? #SouthVancouver #Marpole #Vancouver ?? @weworkcanada @KoreChiro @TransLink @lushcosmetics ? #YVR 
@TransLink should do this!
"I love when @translink drivers on the 23 route are late so they selectively overload the bus. ""I'm not going to stop at this stop bc I'm full, but I'll stop at that one to let people on"""
"It's the driver of bus S523, if you're interested @TransLink"
"@TransLink must praise this driver. One of the best. Shows great sympathy to commuters. While some drivers just pass by, the driver stops and takes as many as he could. He does does not make the decision by himself but trust the commuters will make sound choice. So nice! "
Y’all are more generous than those I ride transit with every day ?
@TransLink Can someone please explain how Lougheed station to Lincoln station is 2 zones when they're in the same zone?
@TransLink why is the 410 20 minutes late just to drive past the stop
"@TransLink 25 min wait on 410 year evening on Cambie, 25 min wait at 22nd st this morning, line of over 200 waiting. SORT 410 OUT, disgraceful sardine service, UNDERSERVICED BY OLD TINY BUSES"
@TransLink Not full and no bus yet
@TransLink did the 410 drivers all fell asleep? We waited for 35 mins for the bus and there should have been 6 already....
"This is a farce... About shorter wait time and effectivement

"@TransLink 58198 Aberdeen, the bus finally came at 8:35 when it was supposed to come at 8:13......."
@TransLink Aberdeeb stn. Well 4 came at the same time.... it is hilarious and a bit sad
"@zhkkt42 @MrNickK32 @TransLink Hi Christopher - this was never reported to Transit Police, hence the confusion. Looks like it was VPD that took the call. Our information is that the suspect was located and arrested very quickly and the gun was turned out to be a toy. ^LT"
@TransLink I will next time for sure thanks for getting back to me !
@TransLink Thanks! I boarded a bus through the back while a wheelchair waited for the ramp to deploy in the front and the driver yelled at me so I wanted to understand!

@TransLink Burquitlam is also zone 3 but it never charged me for 2 zones when traveling from Lougheed
"@TransLink @BCTransit it's not a super serious complaint, moreso just really annoying. it was the 22 stop on Clark and 3rd at around 4pm"
"This is Nico, he’s 4 and a half. He visited me at work today because he’s a huge fan of transit &amp; especially transit maps! He has the entire @TransLink bus network memorized &amp; his favourite route is the 320 &amp; 99 B-Line. I gave him some maps to take home. I’m so proud of this kid! "
@TransLink any reason the bus that’s supposed to be here “now” hasn’t arrived at 50808 yet? Been over 10 mins now

@TransLink also these charges were at times the system is only one zone (ex: last night at 9:00 pm) so what gives ????
@TransLink Ahhh I see. Thanks
@TransLink One of these charges is from October 3rd - does it take over 10 days to send the exact amount to my credit card company? There is also random charges for 20 cents which also make no sense ???

"@TransLink Oops, bad typing. Was 10:48 at the time, not 28. Bus (not plus) was scheduled for 10:45. Left at 10:52."

"@TransLink No, tonight. (I am home now.)"

@TransLink curious why there is no 11:20pm 209? There is one at 11:50 then not until 12:50? 
@TransLink I’m curious why there is no 12:20am 209 leaving burrard station? There is one at 11:50 and one at 12:50??

@TransLink Is Lougheed now open again?
@TransLink Thanks for the few buses and transit people that just drove by me and didn't stop or say anything
"@TransLink is there something passengers should be aware of on inbound expo like trains ? We have announcements that the train could come to a complete and sudden stop, train is moving very slowly , out bound trains seem unaffected"
@TransLink They honked but how do I know why they are
"whoa! @TransLink i had no idea it was so much more expensive to tap your visa at train stations.
i forgot my compass card at home last night and went one way on the skytrain and it cost $5.70! 
that’s double the usual cost. yikes. "
"@TransLink on saturdays too? i totally thought that was cheaper on the weekend.
guess that’s changed?
i’ve had a monthly pass for years, so i thought it was still that way."
"@TransLink @verobeeee @TransLink I have been noticing lately that the buses I take most often (101, 155, 112, 106) are not adhering to their schedules. I get on-route variability but we're talking consistently late takeoffs from 22nd Street and Edmonds."

@TransLink Waterfront
@TransLink No problem!
@vania_pacheco @simonplittle @TransLink Maybe @Sethrogen recorded a psa for @TransLink on not smoking weed on the skytrain platforms... (Insert Seth’s laugh here)
@dfergusson @TransLink The issue I have is enforcement. It’s illegal now and yet when my kids were younger we couldn’t go to playgrounds without being surrounded by both pot and cigarettes.
@vania_pacheco @simonplittle @TransLink Or we could just enforce the law like we do for everything else ????
@TransLink @carmina_dub I think you all should just look into it because we're probably not the first people to report this. (Not you the Twitter people. You're always nice and helpful.)
"Hey @TransLink, people still need to go along the Broadway corridor on weekends. Would you please look at increasing off peak 99B service so people don't have to wait 15 minutes only to not be able to get on because the bus is full.

@Scott_dLB @TransLink The 99 B-line: where it's ALWAYS rush hour.
"@DevonRowcliffe @TransLink I get decent service eastbound at 9pm on Thrusday, when I am heading home from recording @PolitiCoastPod. But god forbid you have to go somewhere on Broadway during weekday peak hours or any time on the weekend"
?@TransLink? there appears to be a basketball in the guideway at Edmonds Station 
@TransLink Done.
"@TransLink hi, can u tell me if the 323, 314, or 329 go by 96th &amp; 128th tomorrow morning around 8:40? Thank you"
"@TransLink hey can you guys not use the buses with the luggage racks on the 99 route. It’s already a super crowded bus, it’s worse when the driver scolds people for standing near the doors when we have no other option. "
I'm this boy but like 17 years older.
@TransLink Then why isnt it used on that route?
@TransLink Yes I guess the direction is important ????? sorry. To the skytrain
"Finally, why isn't (or is?) @TransLink not offering free rides on municipal election day in Vancouver? Some cities/municipalities are offering this and I think it would be a very tangible solution to concerns about organizations offering incentives/inducements to voting."

@TransLink 1st/12ave
@TransLink 55235 where the fuck is the 502
@TransLink Why the previous bus (1:28pm)  cancel?
@TransLink 
@TransLink this is the second day in a row that the 312 (Scott road) just hasn’t shown up and it’s super frustrating and not at all okay
I can’t believe I pay @TransLink $174 a month for buses to be consistently late by 5-15 minutes. Crazy
Maybe time for more transit investments in #bcpoli eh so transit works for more souls?  @BCTransit @TransLink #YYJPOLI
@TransLink 54895. Yesterday the 12:45 bus didn’t come and today the 2:12 bus didn’t show.
@TransLink where is car 418
@TransLink @BrandonLal Do you have a video of the incident? You are low key tearing down the RCMP and I'm assuming caucasian Canadians without any evidence. You never even tried contacting security so this couldn't happen to another commuter. Plus you plugged some shit screening of some shit?
"We wait another ten minutes or so for another, 4 times the damned @Sethrogen 'Move to the back of the bus' message plays, but each time it plays it repeats 3-4 times all over the course of a 10 minute ride. My temper was pretty short by the end.  @TransLink needs to be shut down."
@mimischap @TransLink LeBron James is at again!
@TransLink At 2:57 it was at Commercial-Broadway. How do I know that? 
@TransLink This man with a walker has been asking for $2 to go to hospital at 29th Ave skytrain station. I saw him three times the past week already.

Can we one day where the 640 isn't slowed downed by traffic or construction. I think there should be an express bus that goes down hwy. 17 instead of all the back routes. Getting from Tilburg to Scott rd station shouldn't take over an hour. @TransLink

"@5102N @CTVVancouver @TransLink Yeah, that's also an issue. If it is just the smell, and not smoke then at least there is the option to move away from them there.

@TransLink Can I still board the 410 to 22nd Street station at 58253 Eastbound Anderson Rd @ Buswell St? Its where the bus starts but says unloading only
"@TransLink No bus going in between Cypress Park Mall stop and Horseshoe Bay via Marine Drive , West Vancouver????"
Yall got everyone angry and late waiting on this 116 @TransLink
"Canada Line just came to a very jagged stop at Aberdeen, throwing people about. It's not opening doors. We're just sitting here cc @TransLink"
"@TransLink This bus is mostly used by people trying to get to work.  Something which you are advertising people should do, but people are constantly turning around and going back on the skytrain or taking taxi's instead because the 116 bus is absolutely unreliable."

While in Vancouver Alex Hunter created a video of Vancouver for @Attache_travel. What I loved was that he spent nearly a third of the piece describing and lauding the public transit infrastructure in Vancouver.  @TransLink (2/2)
@TransLink what is causing canada line delays?
@TransLink I'm on that speciL shuttle already. Will this b a whole day thing?
@TransLink I just got off the 33 bus at Main Street. Your driver's quick reflexes saved us from getting hit by a terrible driver. Kudos to hiring such a good guy!

@TransLink pls add more 239 buses to @CapilanoU during peak hours. Majority of classes are held at 1pm &amp; now this line of 60+ people are going to be late. This is pretty ridiculous. 
@chrischok @TransLink Good stuff!
@TransLink Whoops - a mistake as you used November instead of October dates for loading for a November compass card. Maybe delete this one above and correct?
@TransLink @yporquepues @CapilanoU With “ Eye in the Sky” have you eliminated Transit Supervisors and Traffic Checkers that could do load checks?
@Merton_V @TransLink That person probably had too many cookies.

@TransLink work crews installing scaffolding at Stadium station have been at it for days. Loud banging ALL NIGHT has been interrupting our sleep for a week. When is this expected to conclude?
"@TransLink Don't see anything specific about the scaffolding, perhaps as I'm too sleep-deprived. Please let mgmt know that we'd appreciate details re: the scaffolding noise. It's INSANELY LOUD hammering metal together for HOURS. Station signage describing work would have been appreciated."

@TransLink what is going on with the #canadaline ?? off schedule and long waits in stations...
@TransLink is there a reason why it’s taking so long to get to downtown on the Canada line? Keep stopping randomly and now we’re just sitting here at Oakridge...
@TransLink hi I’m at Aberdeen waiting for the Canada line.. what’s the delays about?
@TransLink Any reason why the Canada Line just stopped between stations?
@TransLink extra long stops at Canada Line stations... taking much longer than 28min from Waterfront to YVR...

@BloedelConserv @TransLink Is there paid parking in addition to limited free parking?
@TransLink keep hearing announcements about technical problems affecting Canada line. Any idea what those are.

"@TransLink there seems to be some issues with the heaters on car 357, they are running like it's -40 out... ??"
@TransLink Thank you very much!!
@TransLink bus drivers should be enforceing the courtesy seating on small buss more often. Front seats taken up by people that could easily move and a mother with a folding stroller ends up blocking the already small walkway completely because she doesn't have enough room. Wow.
@TransLink Thanks for the late reply. Found out after messaging you guys ironically.
@TransLink is the skytrain working now or is there still technical difficulties?
@TransLink The Canada line! Is it working now?
@TransLink hi does the 129 route have any detour??

@TransLink I think it’d be more accurate to say customers should plan for an extra 20 min. The shuttle train is so full many passengers will have a one train wait. Then if they do get on the first train and it’s only a 10 min delay they’ll be pleasantly surprised. But it won’t be “5 min”.

How is the platform soo busy during peak hours? Also to mention all those people who take the train backwards just to get a seat lol.

"Also to mention there's trains that come to KG just to sit and wait for over 5 minutes.. Keep the trains coming and MOVING!! @TransLink

Thank you!"
@TransLink I take the train every single morning at the same time. I've tried coming 10 mins earlier. All the same result. Even if there are no busses arriving at the same time. Super upsetting that some people don't give up their seats for the elderly. Also I've timed it sometimes it's 5+
"@TransLink I actually go to king George.. Just to see platform is full with train stalling there, which is also fairly full."

 Waiting at Joyce rn for a 43 to UBC. The eastbound 43s are bunching like crazy and very behind. Why isn't control truncating some of them and sending them back to Joyce?"
Barcelona will implement a public transportation ‘flat fee’ for all 36 metro municipalities. No more distance-based pricing. #vanpoli #bcpoli ?@BowinnMa? ?@TransLink?  
@TransLink 43 bus coming soon? It missed the 8:48am and I don't see it anywhere close for the 8:54 departure
@TransLink Next time it would be nice if bus drivers could be informed to let passengers sit in the bus while it rains before he goes to Tim Hortons for a cup of coffee! Especially when there is 3 fold delay and passengers have been waiting in the rain for 20 mins! :)
@TransLink I do hope that more could have been done instead of just letting these buses bunch. Also please send out alerts for MVAs. Right now the 16205 and the bus behind it are just sitting at the exchange rn.
@TransLink is there a 43 leaving Joyce station any time soon?
"@TransLink Finally, got on a bus."
"@5102N @DoctorMDMA @CanuckSyko @ScanBC @TransLink Please, the cost isn't insane, many countries have these and they aren't broke because of a wall protecting people from the train.

Don't turn this thread into another 'drunks will pay thread'. Many reasons why people fall into the track &amp; train"
@deedubb83 @DoctorMDMA @CanuckSyko @ScanBC @TransLink What is the cost to install one?
@5102N @DoctorMDMA @CanuckSyko @ScanBC @TransLink Less than astronomical
@deedubb83 @DoctorMDMA @CanuckSyko @ScanBC @TransLink Is there a dollar value on that?
"@5102N @DoctorMDMA @CanuckSyko @ScanBC @TransLink Since it's been done before I'm sure you could find out. I personally do not know the amount.

I'm sure it seems high, but for a more reliable transit system we need to consider it"
"@TransLink Why are your busses consistently climate set ~ 25C, when riders are dressed for 12C? Drivers wear t-shirts because it’s too hot (and they have adjustable hvac). Do you not consider the customers first? "
@TransLink why are the 16 buses so late? There was supposed to be one at stop 51093 at 9:30. The closest one is like 13 minutes away (even if says 2 mins ?) 
@TransLink what happened to the 9:09 and 9:39 324 from 55738?
"@deedubb83 @DoctorMDMA @CanuckSyko @ScanBC @TransLink As a bench-mark the escallator replacement is $14.5 million and is disrupting grandville station for two years.  Compass card budget was $171M and rose to 194M.  

These things are not cheap.  I believe money can be spent more judiciously elsewhere."
"@TransLink @jaasonsmithh Customer service is like a Unicorn , a myth"
@ctv_jon But...the people south of the Fraser keep getting screwed...you know the region with the largest population growth.  We get a crappy LRT system shoved down our throats.  While north of the Fraser it's Oprah...you get skytrain..you get skytrain.  @TransLink is a joke!
"@TransLink @TransLink I love you, but this was a mess. At Cambie &amp; 41 one 43 didn't stop (said not in service but had ppl) one stopped but didn't pick up, and the one that did pick up told us to get out at Dunbar (didn't say why) and then seemed to continue to UBC. Whyyyyyyyyy"
@TransLink what is up with the number 2 bus? Second day in a row that it just didn’t show up (schedule refreshes with a new time every 5 minutes but no bus). Love public transit but this is tough in the pouring rain!
"Canada Line Skytrain doors closes way to early. Someone/something should watch over the platform cameras to see whether there are still people boarding the trains, rather than slamming them on their shoulders. @TransLink"
"@TransLink Worse if I have to alight to let commuters in, but the door closes before my chance to get back inside. But that also highlight the morality issues within commuters in general which is out of our hands for now."
@TransLink thank you. After 4 months you have finally started to repair the escalators at the Seabus terminal
@TransLink @Sethrogen Pineapple Express?
"@5102N @deedubb83 @DoctorMDMA @ScanBC @TransLink To reduce costs and disruption I'd install the skytrain platform screen doors in high probable areas of people falling and debris, notably on the expo line from Broadway station to Waterfront st and a couple stops in New West + Surrey. "
"@TransLink I waited for more than 40 minutes for 43 to UBC for my class.  Great job for controlling the schedule when we needed the bus. 
I have no choice but to get a cab!"
"@TransLink Thanks for the update! No, I was quite lucky - a 43 came at Dunbar not more than two minutes after the one I was on asked us to get off. I know it's not y'all's fault but the resulting difficulties with buses not picking up seemed  weird to me, so I thought I should raise it"
"@TransLink When driver is in short sleeve t-shirt, it's obviously too hot for passengers wearing sweaters and raincoats. New Flyer Xcelsior bus shown has three cabin climate settings: off, heat, vent (fresh air). 120 riders heat the bus you don't need to fry them. This is a service issue."
The @translink fare machines rip me off for small amounts every third time or so.  'Call Translink CS blah blah blah'.  Right. Because they KNOW people won't do it for a buck here or there.  Fucking thieves. #TranslinkGarglesBag

@TransLink They can tell when incorrect change is dispensed?
@TransLink Still waiting for 43 buses in Joyce. While three 41 buses have already made their stops instead. Wonder if this is what you call regular schedule.
@TransLink Reloading.
@jaasonsmithh @TransLink I don’t know if Tim Hortons were a large contributor to translink or something. But apparently half of your 43 bus drivers have to go there and buy coffees while their passengers were left unattended.
@TransLink I'd have more success rubbing a lamp and asking a Genie.

"@TransLink FYI, stop 61649 in New West has no covered shelter. When it's raining, like now, people won't be standing by the stop. 103 Quayside driver just passed and didn't stop."
Hey @TransLink  if a stations elevator is broken or out of service you should always have an attendant around to help Mother’s with strollers or people will walkers/wheel chair available.
Are you going to miss @Sethrogen's voice on @TransLink?

This isn't just a one-off. It happens almost every single damn day. I would know. I bus almost every day. Absolutely ridiculous. @TransLink
@TransLink just out of interest; have you ever put a 2015/2016 XDE60 on the 145? Lol ?
@CassStarchild Hello Cassidy.  Transit in Greater Vancouver actually falls under @TransLink.
@TransLink what happened to the 4:39 185 to Coquitlam Central from Lansdowne @ Barnet and 4:55 701 to Haney Place from Coquitlam Central yesterday?

@CanuckSyko @5102N @deedubb83 @ScanBC @TransLink Pretty sure riders of Translink would rather have a train to Langley than a screen door for lemmings lol I get the safety reasons but tbh # of people effected by having a screen door vs ppl wanting extended rapid transit is a big difference. Not saying safety isn't important.
"@DoctorMDMA @CanuckSyko @deedubb83 @ScanBC @TransLink Absolutely, more rolling stock, UBC line, Langley line all before anything like these gates should be considered."

Why bus 430 is late again at 52018? Late at least 5 mins for last few days. Can't accept this kind of service when we are paying full price."
"@TransLink  I have been waiting at stop 53754 for the 160 since 8:05. The bus to arrive at 8:17 just drove right past me! It was not full by any means. The stop is on the barnet highway, so it's the only bus, it's not like I could have been  waiting for a different one. Lame!!!"
Need to bike/bus during Bike to Work Week? Not sure how to use a bus bike rack? You can practice on our rack &amp; ride in #CivicPlaza.   #NorthVan #BTWW @TransLink @WeAreHub 
@bobr818 @TransLink Yes it’s a slow response time. Continued cancellations of #701 make it very unreliable service to Coquitlam
@JuliaVRst Haha i should! Maybe @TransLink should help me with funding ?
Loving the music and bird sounds in the #skytrain today relaxing @BCTransit @TransLink
Love this!  I am totally intimidated by the bike rack so don't use them.  If I did I would ride my bike more often as I don't always want to ride to and from work.
Hey @TransLink how do I get people to stop walking right on my ass so they can get out of the sky train for free? I’m not okay with paying for someone’s skytrain trip not to mention that close proximity makes me extremely anxious ?

@TransLink Why is our stuck between Inlet and Moody Centre going to Vancouver. We haven't gotten any announcement yet.
@TransLink train going to Lafarge Lake...on the wrong side of the track...a bit too early for April Fools Day isn’t it? What’s up here? ??? I just saw this a at around 1:15 PM today lol 
@TransLink there’s an opened box of black headphones on bus P3357 (152 to Lougheed Station). And it just left Coquitlam Central station at 1:25 PM
"@TransLink Unfortunately not; I only noticed it after I got off that bus (and I was already outside of the bus, saw it through the window) to get on another bus"
"@TransLink I saw it at the very back of the bus, on the seat, I think on the Driver side"
"@DoctorMDMA @TransLink TransLink should schedule breaks for their staff. Period. Busses run on a schedule. The bus was already late and as a result was further behind. To answer your question, no mate I dont. I have scheduled breaks and that is the time that I eat or get things that I need."
@TransLink what happened to the 130 bus that was supposed to come at 1:44pm at stop 52739?
@TransLink Np ??
@TransLink so the 100 maypole was supposed to come at 1:45 at stop 50803. It was late. And packed up. You need to increase that service!

"@TransLink just a heads up your driver for the 413 right now (S528) not only is 10min late, almost ran right by me, stopped in the middle of the road to pick me up, but just insulted another bus driver that was warning him of other passengers waiting for him."
"@TransLink Bus stop 56421, there’s always buses there so the 413 usually needs to pull up right behind them. But he was running late so just sped through, I waived him down, but some other passengers were waiting further along the same stop and that’s where the other driver waived him down."
"@TransLink While I was waiting and wondering if I had missed him, I pulled up an app tracker and he was showing at bus stop 56505 for at least 15min."
@TransLink SkyTrain car 085 has one outside door not opening.

@TransLink You guys really have to increase service on this route. A few people were left behind because of crowding. Yet one other driver was also probably riding for free.

@taciuk @TransLink @Vancouver Seriously?! That's incredible. I'll have to check that out
@TransLink why didn't the 314 pick up at 112 ave on the way to sunbury? Very frustrating when there's only one more bus. I  have to walk and I'll still be late
@TransLink No I had to walk there wasn't enough time to wait for the once an hour bus. It is completely unfair to those of us who cannot afford a taxi. Picking up one person would not have put him far behind
@TransLink on train 5 #wce car 303. The power plugs on the table are blocked. So are the plus across from me.
@TransLink Also it was at 5:11 he was not that far behind

"Hi @TransLink yesterday evening I waited for bus #301 at Cliveden Avenue from 8:12 pm to 9 pm, the bus came and didn’t stop. I had no choice but calling a cab as I wasn’t sure if the next bus would stop or not. Such thing happens often to 301  so I hope more buses will be added."
"@TransLink hi, why is the 17 Oak so delayed? I've been waiting at Broadway and Cambie for over 15 minutes"

@SkriBalZ @StarWarsNerd88 @TransLink And now there’s a stalled train on the Canada Line causing a whole bunch of backup and congestion. Just went past the problem train - same number as the one this all happened on last night. Coincidence?
@TransLink So we can't go to waterfront????
@TransLink You too :)
@TransLink @tatterededge TransLink just spent $9m on RFID to accommodate 11 riders?

@TransLink where the hell is the 319 at 55574 ive been out here for like 20 minutes now
why do you allow this crap @translink? this kind of conspiracy delusion is a public health hazard
@BltProofDiction i guess real estate ads aren't paying the bills for @translink anymore so they have to go digging in the septic tank of human psychology
@corgzone @TransLink “stop attacking my microwave”
@TransLink @Canucks Well nobody will get to the game with these track issues!
@TransLink yeah but it was packed like always are yall ever going to fix the 319 route (maybe a b-line ????) or is it just to hell w surrey we can ride like sardines forever
@TransLink Where was the 430 bus that was supposed to be at stop #58230 for 6:29PM? Was waiting since 6:15PM and nothing. Text said next bus was 7:03PM.. waste of my time waiting for nothing.
"@TransLink hey can you explain whats happening to the 430 metrotown bus

one was supposed to be here at 6:46 and now i see this on google maps "
.@TransLink stop 50740 I was expecting a NB 17 to show up 11 minutes ago. It's very cold out here. What's going on?
"@tonioma88 @TransLink Also no Face or Touch ID, PIN, or password required if you setup a virtual @Suica_App as your default Express Card. With #iPhoneXS #iPhoneXSMax #iPhoneXR, the A12 chip has power reserve feature for Express Cards where you can use your default Express Card even in low power state."
@TransLink the 410 seems to be having similar issues. bar walking to bridgeport and taking a cab are there any other ways to get to metrotown before 8:30
@tonioma88 @TransLink @JREast_official @Suica_App #Suica also processes transactions completely without requiring internet access unlike contactless credit which only captures card ID (regardless if it's physical or virtual) and processes transactions later (assuming credit account is in good status).
"@TransLink No, I took the Canada line instead. How can I find cancelation info in the future? Wouldn't want a repeat of today..."
hey @TransLink can you write up a ticket for someone that won’t cover their mouth when they cough
"@TransLink ""16 minutes behind schedule"" wow.
Yeah because of this delay on #2156 I completely missed not 1, not 2 but 3 #49 buses to get to UBC. I was supposed to be there 15 mins ago. Right now still over 30 mins away. Please tell your Marine Stn drivers to leave on time... "
@TransLink can you turn on the heat on train 332 expo line. It’s a bit chilly in here
@rfaulder @TransLink Just spit in their mouth when it’s open.

"@TransLink not only is the 17 20 mins behind but then 3 buses rock up, the 2nd bus waves all passengers to the 1st, which had pulled up Way infront of the stop, we all walk to it and it drives away without opening its doors...killing it translink"
"@TransLink Yes! It was late! 
When will this bus be every 20 minutes? 30 minutes to an hour wait lately is BS! You have posters up about listening and the added routes? You might want to add this one sooner then later PLEASE! 
#TranslinkFail."
@TransLink is there an issue with 17 downtown bus at stop 61337. As I have been standing here 15min and no bus showed up and the next bus link is stuck on 7 mins.
@TransLink i took a cab in the end :\ thanks for trying to help
@TransLink what the hell is wrong with this company. We have been waiting 35min for a bus at stop 61337 and non is showing up. Yet there is several busses in the bay but your drivers is all sitting in Tim Hortons. This is really fucked up 
@TransLink The bus drivers should let passengers KNOW when they are going to take a detour before they get on the bus. My could have been 7 minute walk home turned into a 15 minute walk home in the rain.
@TransLink Bullshit. There is several busses is this bay but all your fuckkng drivers is sitting in Tim Hortons. 
@TransLink Fuck off. You all just fucking  corrupt and full of bullshit. Stealing everyone’s money you forcing our 90min Tranfer window to expire so that we need to pay again. Fucking assholes.

@TransLink This is not the first time I have been on the bus late night with alcohol being aggressively consumed. How is this permitted or acceptable. The safety of all passengers is at risk.
This should be tracked on all your cctv so why is it being overlooked?
@TransLink goodnight mr bus
@TransLink @Sethrogen @stephanie_ip teach ME HOW TO DRIVE ?
"@translink send security guards into the first carriage of the Redcliffe train, please.  Women with loud music and disruptive behaviour. Highly irritating."
@TransLink It’s in the middle of the night and I left a party earlier to get the last bus 156 from Braid. I arrived there at 1.10 and saw how the bus drove away... at 1.10! It supposed to be 1.25!!!!! Like what the hell!!! It’s the last bus and I need to get home!
I'd much rather cram myself onto packed @Translink buses/skytrains every morning to go work my ass off in an office with coworkers I'd probably hate than having to work at home because the pain gets so bad and is so unpredictable that I can't BE reliable at a normal 9 to 5 job.
@Yacu_mama  Sorry about that!  You can email all the details to mlink.admin@translink.co.uk or call (028) 90666630 after 9am tomorrow &amp; ask for the mLink office &amp; they can sort out a refund for you.  Again apologies^CD
Im on a @Translink_NI train and it is great so far but as it shares it's name with @TransLink I have to assume something stupid will occur.
"@GlobalBC Surprised in this day in age there’s not “an app for that”.

@TransLink ?
@TransLink Thanks will do that
@NEWS1130 His voice gets annoying everytime I leave the skytrain station. Give me Homer Simpson instead. @TransLink 
@TransLink as someone who uses transit daily. Considering that commercial Broadway is one of the busiest stations that the down escalator from expo to main platform has been out of service for  6 months or more. The sign temporarily out of service is joke.
@TransLink the new section will be complete before that is even looked at. As well there has been a shatter Glass sign that has had a fix on it for just as long as the escalator.  Completely unacceptable
@TransLink Why did I get overcharged for taking the bus from the Tswassen Ferry to Metrotown when tapping my credit card? Not the first time I got overcharged when using CC! #scam #creditcard #translink

"@TransLink I am. But I can’t be late for work. It’s not my responsibility as a passenger  to make sure the driver does his job. I don’t expect my athletes to coach themselves (who know have to wait for me to start their class late).

@TransLink I gave it to @TransLink customer service in Burquitlam and they said they will call SPCA. I hope she gets taken care of and is okay (kept warm in a box with some food). I'm praying for the poor crow. Tried to take her to Burquitlam animal hospital but it was closed.

"This is such a petty, asinine, spendthrift decision. “We’re a big city! Big cities have SkyTrain!” Sure, but it was an overly-expensive and daft thing in 1985! With LRT, all of Surrey gets proper transit which much of it doesn’t have at all now! #git"

@TransLink No 49s from UBC this afternoon? There was no 4:12.. it's 4:18 now and no 4:16 has shown up at the stop.. and judging by the line.. there was no bus for the time before 4:12.
@TransLink Think you!
"@CBCMargaretG @CBCVancouver @WeAreHub @TransLink @CBCOnTheCoast 100% me!!!

Wanna know how to put your bike on a @TransLink bus? Here’s @WeAreHub #BTWW coordinator Tom Skinner’s helpful demo (with my trusty old bike). @CBCOnTheCoast 
"@TransLink on the Canada line at waterfront. Use one side to offload people and the other side to on-load them.

This isn’t rocket science. This platform is always an unorganized mess because of poor planning"

"@debtburden @TransLink Sorry, but that’s bullshit. We need people to get out of their cars and onto another form of transportation. To dismiss 150,000 residents of Surrey is bad politics. If it’s Skytrain, then bring it down KG FIRST PHASE."

I probably take @TransLink bus a handful times a year... But this amazing lady driver of #23 makes me want to ride it everyday! Bus number is S532—somebody give her a raise for putting smiles on everyone's faces.
@TransLink where is someone to organize the mess at buses in Richmond.  We’ve been waiting 30 min for 354 with no communication to 70+ people. I did see a supervisor drive by but she didn’t bother to get out of her warm car to say anything or help with organizing the long lines.
@TransLink @alissamwunder You have supervisors?
"@TransLink @alissamwunder As someone who is regularly at what I’d say are busy loops, marine gateway , Bridgeport, Twassenn I’ve never seen a supervisor."
@TransLink @Canucks I live in Hope. Stop teasing me.
@TransLink @alissamwunder Having been a TS I’m familiar with the job.
Hey @TransLink maybe you can paint those yellow lines to help people line up for the 25 outside Nanaimo station. The line always ends up blocking the entrance to the station.

@TransLink bus stop 50354 and there hasn’t been an 84 VCC yet this morning
@TransLink the # 84 meant to be at 4th and Vine at 6.14 heading east to VCC just never turned up... Been waiting here since 6.07 so it wasn't just early either - Not the first time this has happened!

@TransLink fixing escalators at stations must be a cushy job. You never actually really have to fix them correctly &amp; you get to keep on “fixing” them. The one at Lake City Way NEVER works. 
@TransLink please turn off the heat. Train car 088. Expo to waterfront. It’s too warm
@TransLink Again
@TransLink Hi!
@TransLink Hi ^nv. Do you like SkyTrain or LRT Better?
@TransLink what happens to the 604 northbound 56th Street at 4th Avenue scheduled stop at 8.06? Never happens today for some reason.
"@TransLink Hey, are there delays headed North from S. Delta? Haven't seen a 601 or 602 pass stop no. 57370 in a while... I usually catch the 602 at 8:16am"

Dear @TransLink get trains that work
@TransLink Is that a 602 or 601?
@TransLink did the 16 bus for 8:28 at 60980 already pass or is it late?

@TransLink Aw c’mon guys! The 2 buses at a time and then a huge gap needs to be fixed!

"Seriously, I would like to see permits for shutting down car traffic in @CityofVancouver for city blocks that are popular for trick or treaters. A couple hours of free transit @translink to get people where they are going would also help the spirit of Halloween."

@kurtyaki @TransLink this is when they are most dangerous

"I'm at Bus Stop 52041 (49) - @translink in Vancouver, BC "
@TransLink I was on another 110 bus to metrotown station. The passengers were waving at the driver but the driver was looking somewhere else.

@TransLink @Suica_App Excellent! Thank you
@claireallen980 @simisara980 @New_Westminster @jonathanxcote @TransLink @CityofSurrey Then #Surrey should get back all of the revenue we contributed to #translink over the years to subsidize #transit in #Vancouver and got nothing in return.
"@ChrisTifffer @WeAreHub @TransLink @NEWS1130 @CityofBurnaby I think the issue here was not wanting to delay much-needed structural improvements to the BCP. Unfortunately, not many reasonable alternative routes exist. A similar detour was done several years ago."

"@TransLink I notice this form is now much more mobile friendly. However, an extra space at the end of an email address still causes an error. That should have been fixed many years ago. But I suppose I have to deal with the form again to let someone know."
@TransLink ..bus#240..please ask your driver to check mirrors and not be in hurry to leave the stop. I ran..he could have seen me..just I reach the stop..he leaves.
"@TransLink where are 84 bus at stop 50401?
When they arrive they r full..... been here 30 mins"
@TransLink @TransLink .this happened around 5.35pm..capilano mall.. going to downtown

@claireallen980 @simisara980 @New_Westminster @jonathanxcote @TransLink @CityofSurrey Funny coming from the mayor of a tiny community that already has 2 Skytrain lines and still can't get his own traffic gridlock under control. Wonder why he hasn't commented on the cost of the NDP cancelling the Massey Bridge construction???
"@TransLink, do we have a be more awesome note for wrong door boarding?"
"@TransLink I have not but I will when I can, is there a reason for our delay as well?"
@TransLink Already filed many complaints but nothing changes...... usual story
@claireallen980 @simisara980 @New_Westminster @jonathanxcote @TransLink @CityofSurrey Funny coming from the mayor of a community that already has 2 Skytrain lines and still can't seem get his own traffic gridlock under control.  Just wait until most of his police force abandon him for Surrey PD then listen to him whine.
About time @TransLink links to @transitapp! 
@TransLink The 555 (p9207) stopped at the Surrey exit stop then waited for almost 10 min now. And now the 555 behind us passed us and we are still here. And the bus driver hasn't made any announcements or explained the problem. I don't mind waiting but its nice to be informed.
That feeling you get when you think you've figured out the best way home on @TransLink only to realize the earlier bus may not exist

@JanetBrown980 @CKNW @GlobalBC @TransLink @NDP @keithbaldrey @richardzussman @LizaYuzda The mayor-elect has ignored the ridership projections: 80% of riders on a SkyTrain extension will be Langley residents. His residents/taxpayers will make up only 20% of the ridership. This is a BAD financial deal for his city!
@TransLink I just noticed the rider in your logo became a witch and there are trick or treaters with Seth. That's awesome!
Thank you @TransLink bus driver who found a NIS bus  to make the scheduled 6:35p depart. frm Metro instead of just cancelling and making evry1 wait twice as long. #publictransit #transitwin #thanks
@TransLink Oh hey it's the new tweep! Hope you're enjoying the job!
@TransLink I sent DM loooong time ago
@TransLink bus no 160 is always late ..by almost 10 minutes.. very unprofessional and disrespectful
@TransLink It’s been over 15 mins now .. for such a disruption there should be some update .. and this is not the first time
@TransLink Thanks and your profile picture is hahahaha ?
@RlefurgeyRyan @TransLink And you obviously have too much time on your hands pal. Go troll under a bridge.
@TransLink Is bus 101 to Lougheed on the way to 6th st/ 6th ave?
"@TransLink I got on the 144 SFU at Sperling. And it was 20 mins late so there was another sfu right behind it. Supposedly, we were to board that at Duthie and Hasting. That empty 144 ran for its money and a 95 left us b4 we could board so we have to wait in the rain. Why??"
@ibushfield @TransLink Would love to see a staircase from the bridge down to GI to allow for easier pedestrian access from downtown.
"i've been patiently waiting for one of the seth rogen translink lines to include his laugh

@TransLink hey, cmon"
"@TransLink Im on the bus, I dont think it's on time, i was waiting from 710pm till now 735"
@Sethrogen Thank you for doing the PSAs for @TransLink they're really funny.
is one of the credentials to be a bus driver for @TransLink to be a complete asshole to everyone?
@TransLink Okay Will Report thanks
@TransLink Thank you!

@ehsanmok @TransLink ?
@TransLink  is the 320 EB going to show up at Surrey Central? Been here waiting since 8pm
"@TransLink @VancouverPD FYI, someone is smoking on the skytrain platform at Main St station."
@TransLink Thanks for your reply
When there’s a packed bus. Ppl need to take there back packs off #besmart @TransLink
@TransLink why is the 9:50 pm 319 from Scott Rd only going as far as Scottsdale? Is this a new service? I thought all 319 go to Newton?
Nice Logo there @TransLink ?
@TransLink people do use your system at night. It would be wonderful if you could take steps to improve night time transit.
@TransLink this scheduled track maint. is a huge pain in the ass. get your act together please.
I personally have a lot of respect for @TransLink staff. #Kudos to Surinder Sahdra for helping a very upset man off a bridge.
"It's kinda like being kicked when you're down when you work late on a cold/wet night and a completely full @TransLink bus passes you by near the beginning of the route with at least another 30 min wait until the next bus. Luckily, there was a @car2goVancouver nearby."
"@TransLink @car2goVancouver Thanks, I will."
"@CBCMargaretG @TransLink @WeAreHub @CBCOnTheCoast First step is to make eye contact/signal the driver before you step off curb and in front of bike so they can apply parking brake. And when exiting let them know you need to grab bike, and fold up rack after removing."
@TransLink Hi I had strange thing today. I have monthly pass valid until 31th October but suddenly I couldn’t go through a gate and was forced to pay for $1.35 today. It looked a machine didn’t recognized my pass and tried to use my deposit. How can I get refund for this?
@TransLink The 112 but I’m sure it’s happened to several other people taking any other bus. I think it’d be more ideal for updates or announcements for PUBLIC transit be made for the PUBLIC and not through PRIVATE email or text for people who sign up for it
"@TransLink Most people depend on even social media for things like this, but updates can’t even be searched up. The only time a person I know has gotten an update was when a commuter called translink."
"@TransLink Most people depend on the app, but why should we have to contact translink directly to get real updates?"
"@TransLink Most people depend on the app, but why should we have to contact translink directly to get real updates for public transit?"

@TransLink unbelievable ubsrbdbrigh
@TransLink unbelievable !!!! was standing in the rain right by the bus stop at 4 mins back!!! a bus left and they dont even care even in wave my hand!!! so bad  ?

@TransLink how does thie affect 410 route
5:54 #RICHMONDBC The earlier problem on Cambie Rd between 5 Rd and Jacombs Rd is now CLEAR
@TransLink Has the first 128 Westbound of the day been cancelled? I arrived 3 minutes early and have been waiting 11 minutes so far...
"@TransLink I don’t generally catch a bus before 6am unless I *really need* a bus before 6am, so I am getting quite antsy."
@TransLink Not useful: The next one isn’t even due dor another 13 minutes.
@TransLink good morning I got on the 503 to aldergrove bus#s9228 and the bus driver is really hard in the gas and yes braking really hard to the pint where. I'm almost sliding off my seat

@TransLink MVA Marine east of oak has really got things screwed up
@TransLink When are you going to fix your escalator at Burrard Stn!!  It's been weeks!!
@TransLink why haven’t you sent buses from VTC  via Granville? Oak has no access.
@TransLink Publish Twitter New Reply Message! 1540993550652
@TransLink Where is the detour? Is the bus running SB along Oak between Broadway and King Ed?
@TransLink Why did the 104 not come to 52356 at 6:53am? ??
@TransLink you guys should get your act together. It was almost an hour from the time I notified the Duty Manager that marine W/b and N/b Oak were blocked before a detour was set up and buses were still coming into service from VTC to try and use oak.
@TransLink Is the 7:03am coming??
@TransLink Been sitting here since 6:45am. Unacceptable ??

@TransLink morning! 7:45am WB #33 at stop 51818 is late as usual… 7:52 is already here. How does this keep happening?
@TransLink is the 7:54 312 still coming to 54890 or was it detoured?
@TransLink more 49 UBC BUSES PLS.

@WOLFFISM @TransLink This.
Hey @translink have a conversation with your driver that just drove past stop 50849 about stopping to pick up passengers. Nothing like standing around in the rain.
@TransLink No worries...just wanted to bring to your attention..that's all.
@TransLink another morning another lack of reliable service. Three completely full busses have driven by without stopping at 50071. This needs to be fixed!
"@TransLink hi, what’s happening with the #8? My app says it’s delayed by almost 15 mins. Thanks!"
@TransLink Any idea when the next 10 is coming to Granville &amp; 12th ave?

@TransLink The bus had about 8 people standing. The driver wasnt paying attention.
@TransLink 8:17/8:33 210 Buses at Burrard are a no show
@TransLink Another 15 min and still no bus
@TransLink how long does it take to fix this single glass panel at Commercial-Broadway? It's been a broken eyesore for months 
@TransLink any update on 95 SFU? Second day in a row waiting at Holdom for over ten minutes for the bus
"@TransLink need more buses in the morning at Cypress &amp; Burrard, heading DT. 3 buses full so far. 30 minute wait."

"@Translink please sort out the 545-afternoon route from Bridgeport … **LATE** departure &amp; packed bus is the norm. On Monday two buses never showed resulting in long &amp; irate commuter queues ? Don’t blame tunnel, ‘cause the 542 uses the same route and **ON TIME** is its norm. "

"@TransLink why have the buses in Burnaby decided not to show up this
morning. 110 and 129 more specifically"
"@TransLink The driver has ears. He’s fully aware there is LOUD music coming from the bus. I pay my fares because that’s what I need to do: but for that money I should be able to travel in comfort without a man’s feet essentially in my lap, and offensive music blaring through the vehicle."
"@TransLink My point is, aside from using my money for the regular things like fuel, wages etc, maybe use some of it to deploy more Security to check that people are paying their fares! And please, less of the sass in your next reply please..."
I don’t know if I’m just in that frame of mind today but I swear @TransLink buses in #SurreyBC make a creepy “hooo hoo hoo” sound. No joke!!
@TransLink I've been waiting for an 84 bus since just after 9 AM &amp; three vehicles have gone past me without even trying to let me and my wheelchair on. Who do I complain to?
Sometimes my decision to take @TransLink is because I don’t want to lose my prime parking spot in front of my appt.
"@TransLink I was at the Main &amp; Second stop -- I'm on a bus now. I understand that this is a busy time of day, it's just frustrating to see drivers let multiple ambulatory people on the bus and then claim there's no room for one of me."
"@TransLink honestly it is absolutely ridiculous that the 480 to UBC is alwats late, full, or just missing altogether. I shouldn't have to plan my transit 30-60 min early just to make sure I can be on time. Multiple people have left feedback for this route already, myself included"
@TransLink It's always something.  Good thing the 7:52am is so reliable and the driver is so great.  Thanks for the reply.
@TransLink fix your services idiots
@TransLink Thank you. I got angry with the driver of the third bus that passed me &amp; I don't know his vehicle number or anything but I do apologize; I know it's not his fault.
"@TransLink It happened quite often with 101 WB and SB, late and skipped. Hope it can be improved."

@TransLink @neonhandshake Inform? Ha another Unicorn
@TransLink why is the 17 (both Oak and Downtown) running so far behind schedule today?  Waiting for extended periods of time this morning.

@TransLink where is the 430/407 at stop 56975???
@TransLink why is the 123 to New West stn always late?! Every day this week it’s been a minimum of 10mins late. And again today it’s at least 10mins late and nowhere in sight. *sigh* bus stop 51418
@TransLink Been waiting over 30 minutes ?
@TransLink the 152 leaving coq station at 1120 was a no show and its bad enough that google gives incorrect bus times when using the feature that lets you plan ahead before departure
@TransLink why is 27 bus so unreliable. Standing here because bus is 20 mins late looking like a fool. ?
@TransLink 51719. Supposed to come at 11:45...still no bus at 12:05??
@Aegiardini Should @TransLink expand the scope of its police force to do grammar checks @Aegiardini? :)
"@TransLink the 143 to SFU is almost always late, and frequently doesn't come. Pleeeeeease fix it."
@TransLink NOPE. 27 has consistently failed to meet my minumum expectations. I understand the mech issue. What about the 9 min delay for the other bus? That’s a 29 min elapsed delay right there. Never stepping foot on a 27 bus again. Your other bus routes still rock though.
@LCCDomBautista @TransLink This was on the Toronto Subway - TTC!
@LCCDomBautista @TransLink It would never happen on a TransLink bus/train.

@TransLink since when are bus drivers allowed to kick people off the bus so they can turn around at Burnaby city hall ?
@TransLink didn't get bus# but it was the 5:54 123 Brentwood. The6:10 passed right before he told us to get off and wait for the next one. driver took advantage of the fact there were only couple people on board. This type of detour is smtng u tell passengers before they board.
Well done @TransLink you suck again! Stop 51248 was supposed to be here at 7:15pm and guess what no bus!
It is so stupid that @TransLink compass card machines do not take anything larger than 20s. Sometimes you have 50s and 100s.

@TransLink bus stop 50354 and there hasn’t been an 84 VCC yet this morning
@TransLink Time check please.
"@TransLink  Big coffee spill on skytrain car #102, running down almost the whole aisle. :("
@TransLink bus 555 MIA? Huge line up in the rain @langley station
@CityofSurrey @TransLink how about a bus shelter at stop 58783 ?  Would be good before 2019.
@TransLink when’s the next train at king george?
@TransLink Bigger than usual crowd waiting for west bound skytrain — is there delays this morning?

@TransLink are trains not running to waterfront from lougheed station??
@TransLink how come the compas machines inside gates at stations don’t allow purchases of monthly passes? Sometimes the outside ones are lined up &amp; inside ones available. Would move lines faster. #skytrain #vancouver #burnaby
@TransLink just lost my ids and credit card on the no.3 main bus around 7:30-45pm today who do i contact if found?
"@TransLink what’s up with the 17 lately?! 20 min wait today only to drive by full, before 8am. Plz consider adding more buses, esp on rainy days?"
@TransLink is the 95 SFU still making its stop at Granville even with the construction nearby? I see the detour for 95 burrard but? Thanks!
To people who block skytrain doors and don’t let people off first. Please stop #TransLink #Translink #Skytrain @TransLink
"@TransLink just an FYI, Vancouver bound skytrain, the platform sign says it is closed but the trains are still coming."
"Hi @TransLink,

1) An escalator at Commercial Station has been broken/stairs for 4+ months now.
2) It's covered in garbage, guess there is no responsibility to clean
3) I saw someone slip on said garbage today

Take pride in our Skytrain stations. @clairetrevena @jjhorgan"
"Seriously, @TransLink: this is the 2nd time a 101 driver has missed a turn and caused a huge delay... That I've been a part of. I think it's even the same driver. Like.... Really..."
@TransLink what’s up with the 44? Waiting at stop 50044 for 20 minutes.
@TransLink Will do.
@TransLink I forgot to renew my monthly today and it took money off my card. I bought my November monthly today so could you refund the $1.85?
@TransLink Thanks it just came but about 15 minutes late? I’d been there since 8:06.
"@TransLink I've filed a complaint via phone. Like the driver did the dumb thing: spent 20 minutes doing a circle just to make sure to hit 2 stops instead of getting back on route and missing 2 stops. Now, the other bus, which comes 20 minutes after, will be right behind us when"
@TransLink THEY could have picked them up
@TransLink any specific reason for #expoline running between Waterfront-Production Way University every 6-7 min even during peak hour? Pretty much the slowest out of all lines.
"@TransLink Yeah, thanks"
"@TransLink at stop 50633, 8:19 8:24 8:29 scheduled buses all no show"
@TransLink been waiting for the 95 EB at Nanaimo for fifteen minutes. Where the busses at?
"@TransLink I'm pretty sure this is the same driver that drove across the queensborough bridge, when the 101 stays on this side of the bridge at all times. This seems to be a repeating pattern of not paying attention to one's route."
"@TransLink for the past 3 days the 603 hasn’t been coming at the right time, it either is not showing up or comes far to early. I just end up waiting 30-40 mins in the rain. I’ve been taking it for 2 months and it’s been fine up until recently? Any reasoning?"
@TransLink How long till she isn't paying attention and drives through people or off the road?
"@TransLink Waiting bus #100 in the stop 52202 for 45 min, what’s going on?"
@TransLink How many detours that dont effect your bottomline profit but just the commuter is it gonna take till drivers like this are punished and removed?
@TransLink Thanks !
"@TransLink it is currently ""rush hour"" going to SFU and this is the locations of the 95 buses with the next east bound bus @ Hastings and Nanaimo. Why is there no consistency? "
"@TransLink 410 to Brighouse is already running 20 minutes late, and yet there are two busses just parked with the number flashing on the front

Are we just not going to get picked up? We're at the very first stop!"
@TransLink why is it taking 17 mins for the next bus on main/downtown NB stop 59837
"Hey @TransLink , what's up with the 100? No service alert, but it's not been around and missing stops on old Marine. Lines at every stop."
@TransLink Is there any reason you haven’t posted any information about the 100 Marpole issue. I’ve been waiting at Marine/City’s Edge for 40 minutes and just heard from another rider that I need to walk to Marine/Kerr to get on the bus.
"@TransLink Aye, cheers."
@TransLink Thanks for the update.  I decided to walk
@TransLink New Westminster
"@TransLink 57459 is the stop number. I would arrive at the bus stop at 8:23-8:25 every week day, and would wait till 8:40 until walking up to 56th to catch the 602"
@TransLink 16th and 57th
"@TransLink I know. I’m on the bus now, just would have liked to know an hour ago when I originally got to my stop."
@TransLink Do you have busses waiting in order to fix the intervals so that 80% of the buses aren't running in one direction at a time?
@TransLink A little slow on the draw there. Several people and I had to walk several blocks in the pouring rain just to get to a stop where we'd actually be able to catch a bus.
@TransLink a nice view from expo line. 
@TransLink hi translink this really unacceptable as how people abuse transit. It’s really an hazard what if train stops suddenly!!

"@TransLink the #50 bus just left the Olympic village stop EARLY, we saw it and ran - and while he was still stopped at the light he wouldn’t let us on...a mother &amp; her baby in a stroller in the rain. So brutal. #notimpressed #notasafetyissue #rude"
"@TransLink Well, it's happening again today."
"Hey @TransLink! Please, increase the air flow inside SkyTrains! Everyone deserves a fresh air."
@TransLink 9:43 and he finally shows up.  I'm supposed to be arriving at my stop now.  Busses have been making me late across the board for 2 months straight now. How do I get a refund for my month pass?  This is the most terrible service I have received since I moved here in 2000!
"From testing tire socks for busses on Burnaby Mountain and changing up bus routes to make them safer to SkyTrain de-icing and Canada Line heat tracing, @TransLink is about to announce its 2018/2019 winter plan, an extension of what was put in place after last year’s brutal winter "
"@TransLink Thank you-will do. 95% of your drivers are amazing &amp; this rarely happens, but was just frustrating because he saw me running with a stroller &amp; purposely pulled away early from the stop even while other ppl waiting were motioning for him to stop, then ignored me when I stood there"

@NeetuGarcha @GlobalBC @TransLink You and Trans Link don't know what a brutal winter is...
Your app is still awful @Translink! Doesn’t show the bus I want - the G1 - (which is shown on the screen at the stop I am currently at) and STILL showing services for the next day. Please sort this! #FirstWorldProblems 
Yes. Finally. Bus must run even it’s snow outside...it’s public transport . #vancouver #bus #winter #snow #?????? #canada
.@TransLink VP of operations Mike Richard talks about how the company keeps people moving in the winter - everything from heating up tracks to clearing snow-covered branches out of the way. @BlackPressMedia 
"@TransLink is ramping up its maintenance on SkyTrain this winter. That includes more staff on platforms and heaters along the tracks. More details coming up on @GlobalBC @CKNW 
#winter #transit "
"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst, that’s @TransLink’s motto w/ winter prep. Among biggest issues:
ice build up on power rails, issues w/ snow-laden trees, branches falling on the tracks &amp; chunks of ice/snow falling onto the tracks, triggering track intrusion alarms."
@TransLink @Translink_NI Oops!!!! That’ll teach me to tweet without first putting on my glasses ?
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW That's not going to help the trains run on time..
.@TransLink VP of Operations says staff will be on platforms to turn off detection systems. Track switches have heaters to melt the build up of ice/snow &amp; allow switch to move freely. As for ice build up on power rails: a de-icing agent is used to prevent ice build up. 
@TransLink stop 55924 how much longer is the 337 gonna be

@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW Media hype and hysteria as usual.

@TransLink just wondering where the 27 kootenay loop bus is at stop No 60285. Next scheduled isn’t for 26 minutes but one should be here at 11:33am
Thanks a lot for the 11:19am bus driver in charge of the 100 right at marine drive and victoria going towards 22nd station for not stopping and just driving by with an empty bus. I hope you're day goes well too! #jkkarmawillgetyou @TransLink #100isthesecondworstbuslineafterthe319

@iamMarcusFortin @TransLink Aint no joke. God damn bus driver drives like a maniac.

"@TransLink plans to use these tire socks on buses on Burnaby Mountain and Lynn Valley this winter. They cost $250 a set and need to be replaced every 50km or 2 hours. @CKNW @GlobalBC

@incredu55388689 @NeetuGarcha @GlobalBC @TransLink All one sided pro Trudeau too. No balanced journalism whatsoever.
@regan_hasegawa @TransLink @CKNW @GlobalBC what do the socks do?
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW That's a small cost to solve major transit issues. I assume they don't use cables or chains because the damage to roads would be more expensive.
"@TransLink there seems to be a lot of cancellations today, what happened?"
@TransLink Nothing specific
@TransLink Thanks though!
@taylrn @regan_hasegawa @TransLink @CKNW @GlobalBC Keep tires warm ;)
@ReaZavier72 @taylrn @regan_hasegawa @TransLink @CKNW @GlobalBC ?? nailed it
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW No wonder this company is bleeding tax payer dollars and has carte blanc to raise rates.
"@TransLink Not good enough. Most are renters who don't see these letters. Shame on you for not posting this anywhere online. Also, noise is excessive and unacceptable! Crews yelling and shouting all night too. Brutal contempt you show for residents of Vancouver."
@regan_hasegawa @TransLink @CKNW @GlobalBC What a waste. Assume the bus runs 16hrs a day. The cost will be (16hrs/2hrs)x $250 = $2k.  $2k per tire x 4 = $8k/day. Imagine equip 50 bus with these $400k for one day.
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW What do the drivers say about these?!?
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW Will c how it goes. I got stranded so many times with the 95bus
"@regan_hasegawa @TransLink @CKNW @GlobalBC What a waste. $250/set and last 2 hrs. Assume bus runs 16hrs per day. (16hrs/2hrs) x $250 = $2000/day. Run it for a month, it cost $60k no including staff to add tires to them. Better find an alternative."

@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW Are you going to raise the price of gas to pay for these covers? Gas is too high as it is.
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW And this is a better cost alternative to snow tires?
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW I thought they were going to use something like this last winter? Busses were still cancelled up to SFU last winter due to conditions.
@TransLink can I expect a 134 lake city to be on hammarskjold? Or are they not running at the moment
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW I’m missing something with this story bc I’m not seeing how these are going to help on icy hills plus they only last two hours....wtf?....time to raise transit costs again plus gas prices
"@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW I don’t know why people are freaking out over the cost of this, to the point of working out how much this will cost per bus per month.

"Waste of money, install proper tires."
@TransLink Thank you!
Need to know how long the elevator at a skytrain station you use will be out of service? Frustrated by inaccessibility barriers on your commute? This @TransLink project will allow you to quickly connect with their team to have questions &amp; concerns heard. 
@incredu55388689 @NeetuGarcha @GlobalBC @TransLink Oh and if people hate the rain so much and won’t stop complaining about it they shouldn’t live here.
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW not sure how they will afford this
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW I take it the trial went well last year then?
@TransLink @Sethrogen thank god.
@TransLink I gotta say you guys have the best staff all of the drivers were very nice and great to talk to on my commute to work
@TransLink  it’s unbelievable how rude the 145 drivers are. They will stare at me in the eye as I’m literally 2 steps away from the station and drive away. When are you guys going to train your drivers to be better human beings?
"Dozens of vehicles ticketed in parking lot of #Scott Rd #SkyTrain station because lot full and they found a spot at end of row, dinged for $60. Wow.  I feel sorry for them.  ?@TransLink? ?@GlobalBC? ?@jarmstrongbc? ?@SurreyMayor? ?@delford? ? "
"Worried about how @TransLink buses are going to run this winter? Find out all you need to know, and watch me get rained on, right here:
@BlackPressMedia 
"
"If the lot was full, they didn't find a spot. They made up a spot where there wasn't one.  I feel sorry for the people who had to navigate around them."
"@TransLink Considering how the 145 is entirely for student going up to sfu, it’s weird that a bus driver would drive off with an empty bus up to the school rather than waiting 5 secs for the rush of students that just got off the skytrain. Maybe there needs to be an adjustment in policy."
"@TransLink it's time that the public's money be put towards a 24 hour transit option such as Toronto. If properly implemented Vancouver would have enough public funds to provide such an option. We pay higher transit fares than cities that provide buses, street cars, AND trains."
"@TransLink Also, I was standing right under the bus sign when he pulled away. So by your rules, he technically is obligated to wait for me to get on."
@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW Studded winter tires don't work?
@katieguo @TransLink Smh so upsetting
@TransLink Are you kidding? There are NO alerts on your site about this maintenance noise. Only about a shuttle service for passengers during the day. And you've done nothing to ensure your crews work with respect (i.e. without shouting and yelling). Your glib attitude doesn't surprise me.
Vancouver's @TransLink making a buck exploiting the mentally ill and vulnerable. 
@katieguo @TransLink Go off queen!!!!

"@TransLink Looks like one of the fare gates at Waterfront station, Granville entrance for the Canada line, is stuck open"

@TransLink Could you please address the current lateness of bus 562 from Carvolth exchange. Thank you.

@regan_hasegawa @GlobalBC @TransLink @CKNW What a waste of god damned money.  For fuck sake
@TransLink The driver on bus # 2148 # 6 Davie needs to be commended. The driver did something most drivers refuse to do. The driver realized that the monsterous 4x4 mobility scooter was going to take time to load. So the driver opened the rear doors and allowed us on........
@TransLink what time does the 324 newton at 132nd and 72 Ave last bus comes?

@TransLink thank you for not only not uploading my month pass for 24 hours but also shitty customer service
@TransLink like why is it that I use public transit every day and every day something goes wrong
@JanetBrown980 @keithbaldrey @TransLink @GlobalBC @jarmstrongbc @SurreyMayor @delford Just imagine the number of cars that would be off the road if there was sufficient parking at Sky Train stations in Surrey and Coquitlam for commuters driving in from Chilliwack and Abbotsford.
@TransLink My Q was not very clear...sorry...I bought a day pass a couple of weeks ago. How long before I can't use it?
@TransLink Our trip had to be postponed...so it was never used.
@TransLink Thanks!
@TransLink I will do that.  Have a great evening!

@TransLink can you please tell driver of 406 bus R16110 to please turn off the heat. I felt like passing out after getting off the bus. It is hazardous to have the heat this high.

@TransLink  : is it possible for me to use the #LestWeForget  ( concession ) poppie card it looks nicer than the ( adult ) version ?
@TransLink I submitted a lost and found form today at around 2. How early should I expect a response from the TransLink team about whether the item was found?

@TransLink location of the 9:50pm 375 at 55225?
@TransLink Is there an ETA? Out of service bus came and chatted and got our hopes up that they were gonna continue the route before driving off. The bus just drove off with the control vehicle. Funny how it can drive off and strand us but not do its route. Really awesome.

@ContentCanadian @surreyfirst Surrey would be CRAZY to not welcome SkyTrain. Extend that wonderful elevated network! It’s the greatest public #transit technology I’ve experienced on Earth. @TransLink
@thedallashansen @LienusLateTips @TransLink The wait times continue to decrease every year; it feels borderline magical. 2004 was generations ago in SkyTrain years. :)
"@LienusLateTips @thedallashansen @TransLink Indeed, SkyTrain and @TransLink lost a lot of progress when BC’s transit referendum narrowly failed! But there’s fortunately a lot of momentum and some decent funding now for extending SkyTrain. And make as much of it *elevated* as possible!"
@kettlemoraine @LienusLateTips @TransLink Elevated? I thought the plan was for a Broadway subway. Don't put an elevated line on Broadway. That'd be fugly.
"@kettlemoraine @LienusLateTips @TransLink So they added more rolling stock. Commendable, but they ought to have gone with larger, higher-capacity trains from the get-go. 4-6 miniature cars doesn't cut it. Of course in '86 no one projected this much ridership."
"@thedallashansen @kettlemoraine @TransLink With more than the current 4/6 cars the trains wouldn't be able to fit the platforms, sadly."
"@thedallashansen @kettlemoraine @TransLink It was supposed to go underground below Broadway as it is now but to Granville instead of Arbutus, and eventually leading on to UBC."
@LienusLateTips @kettlemoraine @TransLink That's my point. Platforms too small! Should've gone heavy rail like Chicago-NYC-Atlanta.
@CityofSurrey @SurreyNowLeader @TransLink @SkyTrain4Surrey @dtsurreybia @SBofT  This man is from Portland and knows a thing or  2 about LRT. Skytrain is one of the most reliable mass transit systems there is. Ask anyone from someplace else what they think of it.

@CityofVancouver Considering the high revenue from the parking meters in Vancouver up to 10 pm (exceedingly late really) it wouldn't make a dent in it to allow veterans to park for free all year.

@TransLink where is the 595 maple meadows? I'm at langley central bay 4 # 57097 and I've been waiting for about 15mins. It's past the scheduled departure time. Where is the bus?
"@TransLink Too many operators shut off the A/C, which serves as ventilation in the winter, on buses with fixed windows. On 15015 right now and it's warmer inside than out in the sun. This is also perfect for diseases to spread."
"@TransLink Yeah. I saw that from the mobile webpage. 23mins behind on a 30min route is really, REALLY sad. That means by the time the bus gets here I'll have been waiting 35mins for this bus. Was there no way to speed things up, or something? I'm really disappointed."
"@LienusLateTips @thedallashansen @TransLink Elevated stations can be expanded, though. It’s nearly impossible to expand subway stations. Elevated driverless #transit is the most efficient and flexible form on Earth, as far as I can tell. The wait times are amazingly short, too."
@kettlemoraine @thedallashansen @TransLink SkyTrain has many underground and sunken stations though. That's the issue.
"@thedallashansen @LienusLateTips @TransLink Elevated SkyTrain west of Arbutus would provide *incredible* views. I always favor public benefit over the wishes of the wealthiest .01% in Dunbar, etc. It will be a subway until at least Arbutus, though, which is fine."

@TransLink Sorry just looked at the schedule... actually 5 minutes late into Coquitlam
@TransLink #WCE Coquitlam Center has only two functioning compass card readers. Took so long to get out of the station that I missed my connection bus. This isn’t an acceptable level of service- I trust things will be fixed tomorrow?

@TransLink texing bus # stop for 152 from lougheed said bus leaves at 6:55pm but schedule says 6:50pm. is this a glitch? 
@TransLink oh...interesting. it was gone when i got there at 6:51 haha
@TransLink when will the 7:09 324 depart Surrey Central?
@DPDTraffic @deltapolice @TranBC @DriveBC @MainroadLM @TransLink So what kind of consequences would truck drivers be facing in today's situations? Both seemed like pretty easily avoidable accidents that put a lot of people at risk.
@TransLink’s Kevin Desmond makes this year’s #vmPower50 list for how he’s reshaping transit in the region.
@TransLink Why is that? And why does this happen so often with the 324?
@TransLink the TransLink fare review is done? When do you think the changes will be implemented?

@SkyTrain4Surrey @CityofSurrey @TransLink Although I must say @TransLink as I told your Parl Secretary @BowinnMa last April in her office you guys should have referenda/plebiscites like @SoundTransit based on years of public process w/ @EnviroIssues' Erin Taylor quarterbacking.

@TransLink the 7:04 #388 due at Nordel &amp; Shepherd is full and turning people away every week. I've submitted feedback for the past 6 months. When could we expect to see a difference?
"@thedallashansen @kettlemoraine @LienusLateTips @TransLink agreed, the views from the rain may be nice, but the public domain underneath it (and *its* views) will be terrible.

Why is the 100 late EVERY SINGLE MORNING @TransLink I’m cold
@kennedystewart @sam_sullivan @SChandraHerbert this is the 4th #23 bus to go past stop 59394 “sorry bus full”. There are elderly people who have been waiting in the cold for over half an hour. It’s like this every day. We have all emailed @TransLink repeatedly about this

@TransLink When is $8.55 an hour not $8.55 an hour? Uber pay minus car expenses is not comparable to minimum wage bases in the US! What's left out are other significant costs and the big physical and financial risks that take drivers down every day.

@TransLink just love being crammed into the train and having an armpit in the face after a long days work. When are there going to be more carts added on the sky trains everyday I go from holdem station to Vancouver and back and the train is completely full and cannot fit anymore
@RmystiQue78 @TransLink Concession?
@kerrikins @TransLink Here: 
"@CanucksOnARoll @TransLink Yeah, I can't use it. But I preferred this design to the adult one. So literally just a souvenir lol"
@TransLink I’ve filled in the online feedback form a few times with no response so don’t see the point of filling that out again.
"@translink where is the 325 at 55738. It's not here, but it is 5:38 ?"
@RmystiQue78 @TransLink Ohhh lol.
@RmystiQue78 @TransLink I agree it does look better
@TransLink will there be any further improvements to the 106 route coming up soon?
@TransLink @MrsMsTac Translation:  Fill out a form that we'll ignore and maybe you'll feel better about shit service for exorbitant fees.  #WeDontCareWeAreTranslink
@TransLink  why is the number 19 always such a gong show. #vancouver #yvr 
@TransLink Are there plans to add carts on the trains? Thanks for your reply btw
@TransLink Okay. Thanks!
@TransLink where is 5:49 26 at 60208? Also is the 26 at 58249 on time?
"@TransLink hi! I was wondering why you keep bus S7256 operating? This is the 3rd time in a month where the bus hasn't started and we had to wait for a new one. It's currently the 133 holdom stn at edmonds, but it's failed twice as the 116 to edmonds."
@TransLink did a 595 maple meadows get skipped?
@TransLink I think it's long overdue adding LED screens or similar inside trains and busses reminding people of rider etiquette and adding more restrictions regarding loud conversations especially cell phone use  while riding
@TransLink when's the 375 guildford coming to 24th?
"????????????????????????????????????? (@ Gilmore SkyTrain Station - @translink in Burnaby, Canada) "
@TransLink also reminding people of the protocol regarding sitting in designated seats for seniors and those with disabilities
"@TransLink it seemed like there's something caught in the outbound crosswalk at the Snow Shed between Lake City and Production Way, looks like a potential risk to get caught under a passing train"
"@TransLink At Carvolth. Just checked transit app and there’s 2 coming now, one 45 mins late and one like 15 mins late"
@TransLink what do you do about a guy who is trying to take apart the schedule sign at a bus stop with a rock and stick?
@TransLink what happened to the 6:28 320 bus at langley centre?? It’s 6:46 now :(
"@TransLink also the 6:41 345 for langley centre is late, any ETA on that?"
@TransLink @TransLink The number on the side of the bus (not the route number) S7256 has had mechanical issues 3 times I've boarded it in the past month. Twice on the 116 and this time on the 133. I was wondering why you keep it in service if it keeps breaking? :)
@TransLink @translink how much longer to have the burrard escalator broken three months ago fixed. A second one broke last week!
@MrsMsTac @TransLink Okay you can think what you want to Emma. Whatever helps you sleep at night.
@TransLink Got both ? 
@TransLink @Translink my  feedback is that is quite inconvenient for transit users to have 2 out of the 3 escalators at the station broken...
@TransLink Closer to Lake City. Between Lake City outbound and the track switches
@TransLink my bad ? 
@TransLink is there a delay with the 321?  I’ve been at Surrey Central for almost 20 minutes and no buses
@TransLink I may have lost a car key on a bus today or at the bus loop; how would I go about finding out if it was found on board? I’ve already contacted local police and it hasn’t been turned in. Thanks!
"@TransLink are you ever going to sort out the #7 ?!?!? Too infrequent, always late (except when it’s 5 minutes early) ... please fix it!!"
@TransLink Yes I have clicked yes. Oct 18 is the oldest one with no response and then others after that
@TransLink I have not but will do so... thanks for the link.
@TransLink How come I've been getting so many escalator/elevator alerts today? I usually only get alerts if there's a train disruption. 
@TransLink Lest we miss a chance to profit.
@TransLink @mangodesignco Man. I could have filed dozens and dozens before we bought a car. #7 #translink has to be the worst route ever
"@TransLink what's wrong with bus services in Burnaby lately? This morning tons of people were late to work because the scheduled 129  didn't show up. Tonight, waited like 10 mins sitting in the 110 at Lougheed station until the driver finally showed up."
@Van_Pinkprints @TransLink For sure! Maybe I should file EVERY TIME ... that would likely be once or twice a day @TransLink
@TransLink It was earlier this evening at Metrotown bus loop. 110 to Lougheed mall. The same guy blocked the tap for customers to pay
@TransLink Thank you
Get the traffic off the sidewalks @Translink now you’ve got the boss doing it too (yesterday Commercial -Grandview) 
@TransLink @BCGovNews What are you guys doing at Commercial Station?  It's been under construction for like two years and as far as I can tell nothing has changed in all that time.
"@Skyogurt @TransLink How many people do you think actually return their cards? Suppose you have ""commemorative"" card...NOW how many people are returning them?"
"@TransLink Apparently the power has been out for Columbia Stn all day. No lights, gates don't work, tvs are dead, etc."
@thedallashansen @kettlemoraine @TransLink A better solution would just be elevated after Blanca. Building elevated before would be political suicide as it's a NDP stronghold afaik.
@kerrikins @TransLink It's probably easier if you go to the WCE Office at Waterfront or the Compass Office at Stadium Chinatown.
@TransLink I almost lost my left lung running to class + four flights of stairs because 43 at Kingsway to ubc came more than 10 mins late do I get compensation or what
@TransLink Thanks for the link. My suggestions are shared by many but it seems it's of no concern to translink upper management
"@sarahblyth @TransLink Ha, my old tactic. That and under and between washing machines in your apartment building's laundry room. And if you're out and don't want to beg, feel two or three inches back under vending machines (when dropped coins roll, hardly anyone bothers to go there; long fingers help)."
Wtf translink. At Lonsdale Quay until 1144.  @translink
@Evie95 @busuniversal @Stagecoach_East Hmm @stagecoach_east and  @busuniversal aren’t as proactive on twitter as  @TransLink ! Boo
@CarriBell @busuniversal @Stagecoach_East @TransLink stagecoach are a nightmare! so rude in their customer response and absolutely useless!
@_ienea We'd need to look into this issue. Email mlink.admin@translink.co.uk and they can help you with this ^JC
"@garethmcgrath @Translink_NI @lagancollege @ColinSDLP Do the children have shelter while waiting? @translink please call this, should they stay or leave?"
@SineadBradleySD @TransLink @garethmcgrath @lagancollege @ColinSDLP I've spoken to the depot which operates this bus and believe that the children have been collected at Carryduff and they are on their way now - albeit late ^JC
@Eartoot email feedback@translink.co.uk and Customer Services will be in touch with you ^JC
@Translink_NI @SineadBradleySD @TransLink @garethmcgrath @lagancollege Unacceptable TRANSLINK - I am requesting an urgent meeting with the Depot Manager to discuss
@ColinSDLP @SineadBradleySD @TransLink @garethmcgrath @lagancollege Colin please contact us to arrange this meeting. I will advise the depot that you will be in touch  ^JC
@Translink_NI @SineadBradleySD @TransLink @garethmcgrath @lagancollege Thank you.
@TransLink does staying behind the “ Red Line” apply to everyone? Including off duty employees. Not instructors and supervisors.
@TransLink hello we didn't get the 6.22 bus from Bay 2 Edmonds Station. Bus number 133 Holdom Station. Thanks
@TransLink Any idea where the 6:30 101 is going to 22nd from Eighth St and Sixth Ave?
@TransLink skytrain 121 going downtown has a nice coffee spill on two seats
"@TransLink I have an issue! I asked the driver on 501 if I could ? at King George Station? He asked why, the ? ticket won’t work for the Expo Line so I would have too pay 2x I told him! That’s your problem, tell the ? as he writes you a $175 ticket."
"@TransLink 502, was the driver just being an AHole or is this true?"
@TransLink Yep. Just left edmonds
@marklister83 @thedallashansen @kettlemoraine @LienusLateTips @TransLink I think from a pedestrian point of view removing either one would have little impact if the other also stays. I think they both suck :-)
"@TransLink thanks! form sent, fingers crossed too. :)"
@TransLink Maybe you should remove the cash box so you can target people without your card or credit card! I have my card and needed to get too a machine to load it!
"Hey @translink I reported this mislabeled elevator button at Yaletown station to you when I lived in this neighbourhood, so at least five years ago. Is it that hard to make such a simple repair in five years? "
"@TransLink Yup, I seen it. As it blew right past my stop! But who needs to worry about picking up customers when you're trying to make up time. It's not like it affected my connection or anything. Oh wait, it did."
@TransLink would love to give a big kudos to the driver this morning of the 562 got on went to Langley Centre to catch a connecting bus 531. Left my lunchbag on her bus and she looked back around and gave it too me
"@TransLink where is your lost and found located?
I lost my wallet with a Remembrance Day Compass card visible on it, rubber-banded "
@TransLink How much $ has your Compass System generated ticketing us with this problem? Is this intentionally not fixed as the driver stated?
"@TransLink where is your lost and found located?
I lost my wallet with a Remembrance Day Compass card visible on it, rubber-banded"
@TransLink It's the elevator from the ground floor and I suggest looking again at the image.
@translink bus 27 Joyce Station at stop 51717 missed its time at 7:15 AM.... Im cold waiting!!!
@TransLink Why do the  buses and skytrains have air conditioning on when it’s so cold out ... not happy
@TransLink you need to work on signage. This stop was open yesterday with no signs &amp; our bus driver skipped the stop today and basically called two of us liars 
@TransLink So an easy compromise would be too supply your military police agents with compass cards for purchase before they treat us like criminals and Translink treat us like low life’s!
@TransLink I could buy a ticket on a bus in Edmonton that scans and converts too the other system so it must be intentionally not fixed in Vancouver for the revenue!
"@TransLink I have another question, I lost it last night.
In case the driver found it last night, when will he be able to send it to lost and found?"
"Hey @translink, you know if a train comes from KG to Surrey Central and it's standing-room only, there's a problem, right? Maybe send more trains? FFS you probably all drive to work."
"@TransLink WHAT??
Is there any way I can simply walk in and just ask in case my lost item is with them?"
"@TransLink I desperately need it today.
Is there some sort of process it needs to go through?"
"@TransLink Yea that's the one. Sign was up this morning but not previously, it's been surprising all my coworkers too."
@TransLink Y r there EMPTY/new trains going to KingGrge every single morning but those in need of SPACIOUS/new trains going DT are stuck riding the old trains? Same thing goes 4 the evening rush. It makes no sense that I have to wait 2-3 trains just to get on a newer one w/ more space. WHY?
"@TransLink How long does that take?
This shouldnt take 2 days"
@TransLink Are these your efforts to preserve trains for as long as possible? It's ridiculous and completely unfair that rush hours are not accommodated whatsoever. Fix this.
@TransLink And its a bus heading to Langley
@sarahblyth @TransLink Or going through all  the pockets of my out of season coats/jackets.
@TransLink Can carry a bike in the morning rush hours between 6 to 8? Is there any change? I took a pic but won't post it. It's time to re-assure what are the rules and manners.
"@TransLink where are all the buses on the west side this morning? No 14s, few 9s and huge lines on South Granville with lots of full 10s"
@TransLink Heading there right now
@jumpforjoy1122 @TransLink Yes I do that frequently
@TransLink Thx - eventually got on a bus but it doesn’t help when people at back of line rush back doors and make people at front wait even longer! Happy Hump Day :)
@TransLink major props to the driver of bus 2556 for pulling over and running up the hill with his extinguisher to this fire! 
"I'm at Vancouver City Centre SkyTrain Station - @translink in Vancouver, British Columbia "
"@TransLink Please make the 16 run more frequently, both ways, and make the route a stretch bus."
@TransLink I absolutely will!
@TransLink where’s the 503 for langley centre at? This is the third day in a row it’s been late by way more than a minute or two
@TransLink Nvm it just showed up - 13 minutes late lmao thanks anyway
@TransLink Thank you! Fingers crossed tomorrow will be issue-free haha. Have a great shift!
@TransLink any idea what’s up with the bunching of 43s this morning? 
@TransLink has the stop at Willingdon and central Blvd for the southbound 130 reopened now?
@abundanttransit @TransLink I think we need to hold one in Victoria too.
@TransLink I see. On 8129 now so all is well. Thanks!
"@TransLink You might want to check with your drivers then, someone pulled the cord assuming Metrotown station was next, but the driver stopped at Willingdon/central first and got annoyed"
@abundanttransit @TransLink More transit is one issue. Meaningful transit and affordable transit is another issue. It's more meaningful and affordable to keep my car than use transit as it is right now.

"Have you seen these sweet illustrations on @TransLink, reminding you to respect your fellow passengers? They're courtesy of ECU illustration students!  "
@translink can you guys PLEASE fix the timing issues with bus 148 between Edmunds and Royal oak? This bus is often up to 30 mins late(about every other day). The schedule never matches reality and its extremely angering.
"@EvelynLeebody Evelyn, if he emails into feedback@translink.co.uk outlining the situation that happened and attaching photos of the tickets he had to purchase. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience caused. ^CS"
@TransLink why do I get the feeling this door is on the verge of being...”broken”? ? doesn’t seem to be in sync lol was on 214 and it was....”K-D6” (the one in the video ?) #almostbroken #idk 
@TransLink hello!! is the 410 going to 22nd station working ?? the transit app says it isn’t .....
@TransLink It’s rediculous how there’s lack of buses and skytrain from Vancouver South David Thompson area to Burnaby. Vancouver’s infastructure is poorly planned.
@TransLink where’s the 301 at stop 58964 :(
@TransLink The only closest Skytrain station is Nanaimo station but it has no bus to get you there. Rediculous. I might as well walk.
@TransLink I get that but it has happened just about every morning (8 am to 930) since I moved to the area in June. For example today the bus was supposed to come at 937 it did not get there till about 10 am.
@TransLink And I know from living down the street from the construction that traffic is no ware near sufficient to explain that even with construction. They just waved us through.
@TransLink What’s the ETA on that one?
@TransLink What happened?
@TransLink Oh I see. Thanks ! I’ll definitely leave the house later to surrey then
@TransLink hey there's a man asking passengers for help/something to eat in the seabus terminal on the waterfront side
"@TransLink Im not sure if seabus personnel have been notified. The person is in the loading area, past the turnstiles"
@TransLink He's wearing a green sweater holding a tim Hortons coffee
@TransLink He's on the seabus now headed to Lonsdale quay
?@TransLink? is there an issue on lions gate? 
@TransLink Ah okay I’ll head to the next nearest stop. Thanks!
@TransLink it looks like the analog clocks at Waterfront station didn't change the time since last week. Please recheck them. Thanks.
@TransLink can you guys make an elias pettersson compass card.
@TransLink I’m sure there is a sign! I just like checking for the times from home first so I didn’t see it
"@TransLink @CadFairview Yes, its inside the building. The analog clock at the top of the entrance of Canada line and Bar."
"Congrats to all employers who made this list! Shout out to Tamara Vrooman, Craig Richmond, Santa Ono and Kevin Desmond, for being among those mentioned  via @vanmag_com CC: @Vancity @yvrairport @UBC @ubcprez @TransLink"
@TransLink @CadFairview Thanks. Have a nice afternoon.
"@TransLink let's talk.. You stranded 15 people outside the LEC last night, after ""cancelling"" the 501 from Langley to Surrey Central from 9:45 PM onward. When I spoke to a customer service rep about it, they told me ""Transit is not a guaranteed service"". How is this acceptable?"
Feeling symptoms of the flu... then my @TransLink driver ignored my bell and drove 2 blocks past my stop. Not my best day.
@TransLink @AnnaMah12 Isn’t there also a flashing light on the dashboard?
@Ratcicle @TransLink Thanks for flagging. I will pass this along to our Waterfront team!
@TransLink wheres the 134 brentwood station meant to arrive at stop 52899 at 1:33 pm please help me
@TransLink thank u MR
@TransLink
@TransLink Yes I have many times
"@TransLink 
Hi there. I'll be taking the WCE on Friday and was wondering what the difference is between the adult and concession fares? If I'm travelling from Waterfront to Port Haney Station will it be $9.20 or $5.65 that I add onto my Compass Card via the internet."
@TransLink can you please add in your transit protocol for busses that bus drivers need to stay at a bus stop until their designated arrival time??? Some busses that come early just leave and it's mad annoying. 
@TransLink Thank you.
"@TransLink 562 bus did not stop at stop 57190 at 2:36 pm. was not full, there was like 10 people in it."
"@cigazze @thedallashansen @kettlemoraine @LienusLateTips @TransLink An underground station would have less impact, but I'm not sure the elevated rail station is a problem. It actually incorporates shops and buildings into the structure, something done even more tastefully in Berlin."
"@cigazze @thedallashansen @kettlemoraine @LienusLateTips @TransLink The expressway is more than twice the height of the rail line and also creates air pollution, which the trains do not. As we know from SkyTrain in Vancouver, it doesn't deter pedestrians as elevated highways tend to do in other cities."
"@marklister83 @cigazze @thedallashansen @LienusLateTips @TransLink Exactly! Not only are elevated highways massive deterrents to pedestrians for many blocks in every direction, but SkyTrain has been *welcomed* by me as a pedestrian many times when I needed a brief respite from rain. And SkyTrain ADDS to urban vibrancy. Freeways destroy #cities."
It's now dark at 4:30 so #watch4seniors &amp; #watch4pedestrians around corners &amp; bus stops @TransLink 
@TransLink location of the 3:17pm 375 at 55225?
hey @TransLink is there any update on 418 kingswood extension to blundell road indrustial area??
@TransLink is the detour at 58267 / Homer at Dunsmuir still in place or no? Sign says only till 3:00pm.
@TransLink Nice to see things don’t ever change for this bus.
"@TransLink I’m on the 101 at the train crossing on government street, where there’s two trains on both tracks not moving. Because of that the bus can’t cross (obviously) Do you have any clue how long it would take to clear up?"
@TransLink thank you but there is no luck for us?
@TransLink It cleared up!
@TransLink @BeantownCanuck @BCGovNews About how long has construction been stopped?
@TransLink I don’t believe the feedback does much. Union will protect the drivers.
the bus driver literally just wouldn’t let me on and was pointing to the other bus as if i should get on it but it... wasn’t my bus.... @TransLink u ok girl
@TransLink which times does the 239 bus from stop number 54516 leave each week day approximately after 1:30PM? Thanks
"@TransLink Hi, mornings are chilly these days. Will there be heat on trains soon? Thx!"
Holly s**t! There seriously needs to be a limit on the number of people on a SkyTrain car. It is a sardine can in here #skytrain @TransLink
@TransLink any thoughts to fixing the escalators at burrard. One’s been broken for months it seems. Really annoying in the morning rush. Also if you can’t maintain the escalators I wonder how well maintained these old skytrains are...
@TransLink there were no show buses in both directions for the 116 at 4pm. There are about 30 people at each stop on both sides of the route
@TransLink Would be a good idea to send an extra bus in at least one direct for the route
@TransLink Stop 61975 was passed by twice after the 3:45 bus didn't come. There were at least 30 people at each stop after that until I got the Edmonds
@TransLink My complaints tweeted this morning weren't acknowledged. Can someone get back to me? Thanks.
"@TransLink It did, and the one at 4:20 was only able to pick up about 2 out of 30 or so passengers. The rest were told to wait for the next bus."
"@TransLink Other people's tweets after mine were addressed fairly quickly. My issue is that during rush hour, Translink uses the old/small trains, but the new/SPACIOUS trains are running for the opposite route that has far less traffic."
"@TransLink Why is it that almost every morning on my way downtown, I am stuck waiting for a new train (sometimes up to 2-3 trains or more), but see the opposite route with a new and EMPTY train every 2 minutes?"
@TransLink Surely it is possible to ensure that the new skytrains are running so they FAVOUR rush hour and those of us trying to have a more pleasant commute to work.
@TransLink Are these your efforts to preserve trains for as long as possible? It's ridiculous and completely unfair that rush hours are not accommodated whatsoever. Fix this. Or at least explain to me why it is like this.
@TransLink Been waiting 20 min outisde in the cold for the 335 Bus here at Stop 55848 where the hell is it???
@TransLink is there another accident on no 2 road? A bus just went down my street on colville heading to railway and there's never any bus down this way.
@TransLink 30 minutes now... you guys are a joke.
@TransLink 394 @ King George at 5:15 didn’t show up. No updates nowhere. It’s been happening all the times! Either fix you timetable or at least notify people that bus is not coming!
"@TransLink Yep, it was just 15 minutes late ?????"
"@TransLink I'm not on it, I looked out my window and saw a bus passing. 

The 9nly buses near no 2 and colville in Richmond are the 402, 406 and 410 "
@TransLink any chance the Burrard Stn escalator might be fixed by Summer 2019. I know it’s only been 4 mths. New walkway at Commercial will open before escalator is fixed.
@TransLink I was but what the heck was that 30 minute gap??? It’s freezing outside. You guys can’t do that to your customers there was 15 of us waiting in that single stop.
@TransLink Lol ok
"#Wednesday on the #skytrain
@TransLink "
@TransLink no information for 5:39 pm 335 bus. Standing and waiting at stop#60001 . Very inconsistent service and disappointing.
Everybody has the right to feel safe while enjoying @TransLink and should not face any abuse or harassment by others during their journey. #HateCrime #vancouver #britishcolumbia
"Hey @TransLink @TransitPolice why didn’t you release video footage sooner of the guy involved in the hate crime? It happened in September, and it’s now November....and you are just showing footage now?"
Any particular reason the 101 that just departed from 22nd street station left a full 5 minutes early? @TransLink
"@TransLink You know @translink, we the neighbours have tried to tell you and have complained for years about your neglect. Do we have to start sending photos to Mr. Desmond?"
@translink did the 340 at 56023 leave already?
"@TransLink I understand but it’s regularly happening. I have complained so many time for this irregularities, but no improvement. Not only way to Surrey central, impact retiring from surely central too. 335 time need to be monitored and plz understand there is no other bus option we have."
"@TransLink Ye, it's all good, thanks ?"
@TransLink Thanks for the reply. Can't trains be reorganized/moved around so rush hours are accommodated? I take transit daily and almost EVERY day I see new train after new train heading to King George completely empty.
"@patwhite84 @TransLink Unless it's an emergent situation, we make every effort to identify a suspect through investigation before we appeal to the public for assistance. In this case, we are now at a point where the investigating officers are requesting tips from the public."
"@TransLink If I see this happening daily, clearly the trains are organized in a way that works against the flow of traffic. They need to be reorganized so that they benefit the MAJORITY of people and not the minority who are lucky enough to work opposite of rush hour traffic."
"@TransLink Hi, can you check why are south bounds buses not arriving to King george stn? Both 345 and 394 are not coming at all since 5:50 and the line is getting longer every minute."
@TransLink Where are all the 319 buses? 150+ people in line at Scott Road Station/Stop 55835?!
"s/o to @TransLink for their shitty buses, im freezing cold and late for work ??"
@TransLink it’s now been 25 minutes of waiting at Stop 55835-no 319 buses in sight.  What is happening?!?!
"@TransLink I thought, ""I haven't taken the bus in a few months. I think I'll introduce my 12 year-old daughter to the route home from work."" Then I remembered why I avoid the bus now, because it was the same old story: waiting at stop #56064 while the 345 and the 375 DIDN'T COME."
@TransLink I was not on board as there are too many people in line-there are no emails about service issues either.
@TransLink where is the 104 bus departing from 52373. It was supposed to be at 6:43!
Probably just the beginning of the rise of @TransLink and Mr Desmond. Congratulations.
"What in the actual fuck @TransLink 1 hour... 4 no show busses. 1 missed important appointment. Really unhappy with your trash service. What's all my money for? Wheres it going? 

#thanks #boycott #fatcats #wasteoftime #wasteofmoney #taxpayers #waste #garbage #trash #transparency"
"@TransLink The new trains should be organized in a way to accommodate the majority of people. Simple enough. It's fine to have an old train here and there, but at peak times Translink should actually allow the MAJORITY of people to benefit and ride comfortably......."
@TransLink ... As opposed to the 13 people heading to King George on a new/spacious train. It's completely outrageous and appears to be some tactic to keep the new trains new.
@TransLink Thanks for getting back to me. I hope my complaint means anything at all. Goodnight!
can someone at @Translink explain this 173$ ticket i got for trying to buy an EXIT ticket after buying not one but TWO separate tickets that both ran out of time today?!
@TransLink when will the next 320 coming by stop 55128? been waiting for quite a long time.
"That's absolute bullshit considering I WAS ABSOLUTELY willing to buy an exit ticket, what the hell is the point of ""Exit tickets"" if your ticket runs out and you can't buy one before you get a damned ticket? @TransLink isnt that what they are for?!"
"@TransLink not to MENTION I HAD paid my fair, TWICE today, it's not MY fault YOUR trains are slow. DO BETTER for your CUSTOMERS!"
@TransLink Hi there - spoke with a very nice customer service lady almost 10 minutes ago who’s sending someone to let me in the gate at Sapperton (bottom of stairs by railroad tracks). Wondering if they’re en route? Thx
"@TransLink Yes, he let me in and is going to prop door open so no one else gets stuck. Reader isn’t working. Have a good night!"
"@TransLink @BCGovNews thank god i uninsured my car, stick with the program, convert to transit."
"one would think that with all the money @translink makes they could install some heating in the seabus terminal after all these years. But I guess the constant fee increases have to go to paying the CEO more than the prime minister. Priorities in Vancouver, as always"

"@TransLink wow, just came across this YouTube video.   I’m sure it’s already been reported but I hope you guys found those 2 punks and ban them forever."
@TransLink can you remind drivers that #701 stop at Maple Meadows Station is moved to bay 5. They aren’t aware.
"@TransLink OK, thanks for the update"
@TransLink second day in a row that I see buses not coming or even showing up in the gps at stop #50073 .. yesterday the one at 6:09 did not come and today the one at 6:29am.. ?
@TransLink Where is the 112 at 7th Avenue going to NW Station?
@TransLink Yes there is signage for passengers but drivers not aware of change
Thank you @TransLink for making me late for work because you decided to just CANCEL my bus????? I spent 20 mins waiting for a bus that will never come. Unacceptable.
@TransLink Of course there is. You guys keep taking money and provide the worst service.
"@TransLink there was a guy waiting outside the bike locker at Main Street. As I went out, he caught the door and went in. He had a bike so probably nothing but thought I should mention it"
@TransLink There is construction tape &amp; pylons at the Bay; please alert your Translink drivers of change.
"@TransLink Hello, on google maps it reads that some Skytrain Stations are closed. Is that true?"
@TransLink I should have been clearer. I was replying to a tweet of yours regarding the shuttling of passengers to 'Stadium' - last night. NOT the usual canned announcements.
@TransLink How much longer is the escalator going to down for maintaining at King George?
@TransLink Here is the sound of the horror movie. 
@TransLink this bus is already 7 minutes late and is still roughly a 10 min drive away (without traffic). This is a REGULAR occurrence. 
@TransLink Bay 2 has the sign alerting passengers to board 701 at Bay 5.
@TransLink Who is responsible for sweeping the grounds at Coquitlam Station? It’s beginning to feel like a walk through an ashtray.
@TransLink when did the 595 schedule change? There was no notice but scheduled times have been altered
Old lady sitting next to me was watching ABBA YouTube videos and singing along for 5 stops. @translink ain’t so bad
@TransLink 
I’ve always wondered why there  aren’t garbage and recycling bins at bus stops. Anyone know why? @CityofVancouver @TransLink

@TransLinkSEQ @TransLink 28 cancelled yet Translink know nothing about it!  What a shite company! Phoned twice and they know nothing. Can’t tell me where the bus is. No inspectors about either 
@TransLink Hi. Just wondering when the escalator at King George Sky Train is going to be fixed? It’s been ~3 weeks...and the incoming train just came in on the outgoing track resulting in chaos on the platform. People trying to get up &amp; down stairs at same time is dangerous.
@Fraserhealth @NewWestPD @TransLink Great reminder!!
Great reminder!

@TransLink First get yoyu act together and SOP speeding on Willard street. Unlike you want to be exposed in the upcoming press-event dealing with the issue. You are just an ignorant and money-driven company.

@TransLink 55670. I was notified as well by a friend that it has not show up at 61787 surrey central bus loop

@TransLink I see. Thanks

Hey @translink! Time to step up your swag game! cc: @cityjada 
@TransLink I found someone's compass card along with a few other cards. Can you help me return it somehow?
@TransLink I found it outside of the transit system. I don't use transit often. I am downtown. Is there an office?
@incredimike @TransLink Lost property office is at Stadium Station near where the Blenz was.
"@translink I forgot my compass card today. I used tap and pay with my credit card for the bus, but when I transferred to skytrain I had to pay for another ticket at the machine. All within 90 min, 1 zone. Did I do something wrong? I paid double for my trip."

@TransLink the little “train to” displays at gateway don’t seem to be working
@TransLink are they available now?
@TransLink wait what??? You’re saying that they’re permanently broken? Why not replace them with those modern ones that tell you when the next train is arriving
@TransLink  build Surrey Newton Guildford skytrain route first. Common sense says 10 km is less than the Surrey Langley 17 km route.

@SukhdeepDhanoa @TransLink The election promise that got @safe_surrey elected was building Skytrain for Fleetwood and Clayton (and Langley).  If they did a bait and switch now they would lose all credibility.
@TransLink hello?? any customer service???
Excellent talk! Let's work together to buid a better BC. #translink #gvbot #bcpoli #betterBC
@TransLink I caught the 27 bus from Rupert station at 11:37am towards Joyce station.
@TransLink Hey I’m going to post a mini rant not about you but about a passenger. There was a man listening to his music and he dropped his compass card. I tried to tell him that he dropped it and he couldn’t hear me cause of music. He got off. He couldn’t find his compass card.
"@TransLink just out of interest, what’s up with the train at Lafarge Lake? All the doors are open (and one’s open on the side facing the glass) and the lights are off? On Platform 2 ?"
"@TransLink Ohh...ok; thought it was something else, like it was broken, because there were some firefighters and Skytrain employees right beside it ?"
@TransLink Any rider alert for 116 to Edmonds? 12 minutes since itwas sheduled to arrive 61966
@TransLink I’ve been waiting for the 25 Brentwood at Nanaimo Stn for over 30 minutes. Three buses were supposed to come in the time me and many other people have been waiting.
@TransLink Thx for the update
@TransLink is there going to be Compass Wristbands?
@TransLink no 116 from Edmonds today at 109pm
@TransLink why does the 183 bus stop outside of an elementary school whenever I'm in need for it to get to Coquitlam Central and then have my 153 bus leave the moment I get there?!

@TransLink WCE train 1 stopped after Port Coquitlam for several minutes now.  Will the shuttles be held?
?
@TransLink You guys are awesome! Thank you! Have a good weekend!
@TransLink this is ridiculous. WCE passengers pay premium rates and now we are stuck behind a train long enough so that I will miss my bus at Maple Meadows amd have a 1/2 hour wait in the cold for the next one.
@TransLink I know...was asking for one to be played ?
@TransLink LOL! Looking at the map for Bus Route 028 and the colours for Expo Line and the Millennium Line are backwards 
@TransLink is king George train having issues from royal oak because train is not moving from the station
@TransLink train heading to waterfront at edmonds ain't moving. What's up?
@TransLink Wow you spelled it correctly too.
@TransLink you talk about having amazing etiquette but I have 1 guy blocking half a door &amp; whose unwilling to get out the way. On the other side is a person in a wheelchair. You think the able bodied guy would move so the other guy wouldn’t get clipped/crowded... but no.

@TransLink explain to me why every single night the #19 metrotown is not running on any kind of schedule. Or why your customer service agents complain that the text service doesn’t work. Or why you aren’t able to use all the money you steal from us to put extra buses on the road?
@TransLink to whom/ how should an unsafe bus shelter (bench littered used syringes &amp; bodily fluids) be reported? (Note: 2 young children were sitting here moments before I took this picture tonight) 
@TransLink Well how about putting some of our stupid high fares into an accurate gps app system for riders instead of a useless text option and an “unauthorized” translink app. And some training at customer service to be helpful instead of telling me they don’t know when the bus will come!
@TransLink 10-30 minutes late every single night is not “due to many factors” that is just horrible management.
"@TransLink I called yesterday at 7:43pm asking about the same route the nice old lady said, AND I QUOTE; “yes it’s unfortunate that hasn’t been working right for the past few weeks, hopefully they get that fixed soon” I asked for her name but she was not comfortable giving it."

"@TransLink hey guys, can't you do something about how rough the XD40s and 2016 XN40s break? Our operator here (16113/403 Three Road) isn't even going fast when he braked yet it was enough to make people grab on as to not fall off their seat."

@TransLink someone vomited quite a bit on car 106 on the Canada Line. Could use a clean up.

@TransLink How much are the commemorative passes and can we trade our old ones? And transfer the fares there in person?

@LonsdaleAvenue @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @RGuyInNorthVan @LindaCBuchanan @fabulavancouver @NorthShoreNews @BrentRichter Do you only report &amp; question or look for balance? Is this reporting or merely posting a video of what he said? Will you now contact members of our current council or @WeAreHub &amp; give them the opportunity to comment? How many seniors have been injured or killed by cars vs. bikes?
@TransLink What schedule are we running tomorrow?? Weekend/Holiday schedule??
@TransLink  I’m at stop 56403 waiting for the 364.....I’ve been waiting since 8am
"@Jay_Pitter Reviewing other answers, what seems to be missing is importance of *frequency* of #transit 
@TransLink in Metro Vancouver has goal of Frequent Transit Network (FTN) defined as every 15 min, 15 hours/day, 7 days/week. Our SkyTrains much more frequent. Our buses, not. 1/2"
"@tanyapazzy @TransLink So, in terms of a barrier, what’s the challenge with improving frequency?"
"@Jay_Pitter @TransLink 2/2: Two of our train lines arrive at peak hour ~every 108 seconds; one is every 4 min. If @BCLegislature #BCpoli invested in transit seriously, goal for FTN would be buses every 7 min, &gt;15 hours/day, 7 days/wk. *Once it's that frequent, don't need to check schedule. Convenient.*"
"@tanyapazzy @TransLink @BCLegislature Agreed; thanks Tanya. Besides budget, do you think there are other barriers to increasing frequency?"
"@Jay_Pitter @TransLink Money.
Vancouver's trains operated by computers, not driven by staff. Lower labour costs. 
Money for more buses and drivers. Plus dedicated bus lanes. Adds to reliability. 
Better routes for reliability, too. (The less convoluted a route, easier for passengers &amp; more on time.)"
"@Jay_Pitter @TransLink What's the challenge? Political will, car-culture, all the ways we subsidize personally-owned vehicles (POVs) including parking costs, building more parking, traffic, convenience of POVs, change is hard for people, bus seen as less sexy by most, etc.
But you knew that."
"@Jay_Pitter @TransLink @BCLegislature Traffic.
Dedicated bus lanes can help with that.
So can having platforms where people wait for the bus and have already paid or tapped in.
Bus drivers can coordinate breaks differently - taking a different bus after their break."
"@Jay_Pitter @TransLink Oh and mobility pricing is another solution to all the traffic. (Tolling roads and bridges definitely reduces traffic and, depending on how it's done, isn't the most inequitable thing.) Need other options."
"@TransLink Oh, and one last question, is there parking at Production Way/University station? ?"
@TransLink The  fare gate open at okaridge  41 station 
@TransLink Finally!  Long wait at Lougheed Stn for Waterfront train.
@TransLink Increase more people do fare evasion
@northwest31 @TransLink How Respectful ??
"Don't be surprised if buses stop at 11 a.m. for a minute of silence. Also, veterans ride for free today on @TransLink. #RemembranceDay "
"@TransLink Good morning, I am Car 210"
"@TransLink @gaming_yellow You could park at Lougheed and start there, It's just like Production Way-University (1 station away from Lougheed)"
"@_TimJames @NEWS1130 @TransLink Veterans should ride free, every day."
@TransLink this is a good poll
As they should
@TransLink what's the NB 403 Bridgeport detour for? Construction at No.3?
@_TimJames @NEWS1130 @TransLink Don’t be surprised when idiots ask the drivers why they’re stopping. #RemembranceDay
"@TransLink Nextbus has been showing ""now"" for #16 at 58312 for the last 5 minutes. I guess this is another no-show?"
"@TransLink - I can still catch the 103 at the Care Centre, even with the detours fir Rememberance Day, yes?"
"@TransLink Yup, that definitely applies to anything after 8am but for 5am to 6 am, there is no traffic. This is not my complaint only, I saw a ton of people saying the same thing when you were doing your surveys."
@TransLink Thanks for the reply. Wasn't sure if the next bus would come so I just took the train instead. Have a great day!
"@LonsdaleAvenue @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @RGuyInNorthVan @LindaCBuchanan @fabulavancouver @NorthShoreNews @BrentRichter That's the Green Necklace, which goes by 5 schools and 1 Rec Centre.

@TransLink what is your favourite type of SkyTrain cars
"@TransLink There aren't, and probably still aren't. People are stranded. Several of them elderly. As much as I'm in pain right now at least I could wander 5 blocks to find a stop, they can't. If I hadn't been able to flag this driver and hobble over whole he waited, I'd be stuck too ?"
@_TimJames @NEWS1130 @TransLink Shouldn’t veterans always ride free?   Just throwing it out there.
"@TransLink The current signage is for something completely irrelevant. Even if people were to walk to store on either side, those are also closed with no indication where to go."
@TransLink 410 bus going to 22nd stop 58069 due for 12:30 didnt arrive.looks like 12:40 is late as well.any updates? Thanks
@TransLink there is a fare gate stuck open at Metrotown Skytrain Station
@TransLink Nope. We were at the stop since 12:25  and nothing came. Only 406s buses to brighouse. Looks like 12:50 is not coming as well.
@TransLink We are not going to msg you guys if a bus went by. Unless the drivers are putting on different route numbers. Just like the 407 that passed by

"@TransLink Last question before I let you get to other work, will I get towed if I park at Lougheed Mall to ride the SkyTrain from Lougheed station?"
@TransLink the stop time at the 3 airport stations are too short. By the time people get off the train the doors are closed. Need to adjust this to reflect ridership!
@TransLink what’s being built/renovated at the Chinatown sky train station? ?
"@TransLink thanks for these again.
You guys should make a Christmas Compass card!

In fact, invest on seasonal cards so people can keep buying new Compass cards with the new looks every season! "

@TransLink Thanks for the referral. I've actually already filled it out previously. Was wondering if there was an official response to this vital grevience.
WTH @TransLink. When will 341 Newton Exchange will shiw up. Been here since 2:55.
@TransLink Stop no. 56005
@TransLink Nevermind It just showed up.
"Hello @TransLink @WestVanDistrict #BlueBus - my 89 year old dad got on a bus -possibly a 250, possibly a 253 - at Dundarave at approx 3pm today. And has not arrived home. It’s a 10 minute ride. Am looking for him. Can you help?"
@translink where is the 335 at surrey central (55836) to newton exchange/guildford. I have been standing here since 3:50pm and the bus said it was supposed to come at 4:15pm 
"@TransLink we are all waiting for the 301 bus skeds at 4:33pm here at newton exchange, is the bus coming?"
Fun transit @TransLink fact. All the young people clear out on Granville off the 210 #northvan

@TransLink But do you have 8 arms @translink?
"@gaming_yellow @TransLink When I went to the TransLink Pop-up at Waterfront in August, I took the SkyTrain from Lougheed and parked on the Parking Deck at Lougheed"
"@Austin39140404 @TransLink Oh, ok."
@TransLink please send two buses to rescue the stuck 620. That line is already crappy enough.
@TransLink how come has 2 408 busses arrived to Richmond brighouse in the last 20 min and none departed. It is lined up to the station  and is as long as the 401 don’t see ant improvement is this sign says 
@TransLink Not at the terminal on the damn side of the highway. You really have a special kind of talent to transform that crappy road into something worse.
@TransLink You need two so every body can have a seat for a change. You are good to tweeting but bad when time comes to give decent service.

@LonsdaleAvenue @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @RGuyInNorthVan @LindaCBuchanan @fabulavancouver @NorthShoreNews @BrentRichter @WeAreHub I’m asking “what’s the context”? Is this journalism or just posting stuff?
"@TransLink the announcement just made on a held expo line train was really quiet and mumble city. No idea what it said, but I assume it was important. Any chance of a repeat? 421 westbound, though we are moving now."

@Steve_Tornes @LonsdaleAvenue @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @RGuyInNorthVan @LindaCBuchanan @fabulavancouver @NorthShoreNews @BrentRichter This was a very frustrating post with no context whatsoever.

@TransLink are schedules tomorrow the exact same as normal weekdays or is it a holiday schedule/ fares?

"@TransLink why was there no signage to indicate it was short changing, and why was there no warning to passengers while we were still on the route?"

We answered you all the time. The public interest is not @cameronmaltby interest."
@TransLink Hi... so why is today not holiday fares since it's a stat for everyone who doesn't normally work Sundays... which I assume is a large percentage of the population? Likewise why is TransLink running regular service? Seems... overkill.
@LonsdaleAvenue @RGuyInNorthVan @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @NorthShoreNews @fabulavancouver @BrentRichter @LindaCBuchanan @DarrellMussatto Reread yesterday's exchange. You did not answer any questions about the context or story surrounding this video clip. You provided no information. If you are journalism students then your behaviour yesterday is what is offensive. I hope @LangaraVoice holds you to task for it.
"@cameronmaltby @RGuyInNorthVan @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @NorthShoreNews @fabulavancouver @BrentRichter @LindaCBuchanan @DarrellMussatto @LangaraVoice We offer you the opportunity of expressing freely your criticism and you denied us an interview.

@TransLink the 430 bus at stop #51324 did not show up at 2:02
@TransLink what is going on with the Canada line?! It's been saying a 6 minute wait for at least ten minutes now
@TransLink is there an update on the Canada Line delay at Templeton?
@TransLink I've decided to take an alt route
"What a joke! @TransLink is definitely taking advantage of people off work today. Weekday fares, but modified weekday service. #moneyhungry"
@TransLink That is actually not fully information you're giving out. SkyTrain is not operating at regular weekday schedule. It is running at a modified weekday schedule as there is no rush hour increase in service frequency.
@TransLink What time does the compass help centre at stadium chinatown open tomorrow?
@hummasultannn_ @TransLink Girl they annoying af ?
@TransLink I found a SkyTrain like door 
"@TransLink Silly TransLink you write that number like this 4,710,141,650"
@TransLink Thanks
@TransLink one of your drivers failed to yield to an emergency vehicle on Grandview Hwy 
@TransLink Someone dropped their compass card leaving the SkyTrain. Best way to get it back to them?
"@translink @bcferries not enough busses guys, three buses left and there is still another bus worth of passengers outside the arrivals."
@TransLink if the 321 is on the. Frequent transit network why is there a 35 min gap at 55388 for it instead of no more then 15 min all other routes passed with 351 having 2 pass
"@TransLink @BCFerries Another bus just arrived, this was B.C. ferries tsawwassen"
Hey @TransLink the 253 didnt stop at #58704 Good thing I'm trying to get somewhere on time.
@TransLink Thanks and nope it sort of slowed down a sec then sped off. I need to arrive before 610 and I'm not standing here another 20 min.
@TransLink Omfg the stupid translink website gave me the worst directions. Waste of time
@TransLink We have all checked our statements and have all been incorrectly charged $5.70.
@jensaltman @TransLink @MetroVancouver It will be interesting for sure!
@TransLink wanna let control know that expo train 420 is picking up all their radio communications
dear @TransLink your PA system is transmitting that radio call.
@TransLink Your welcome
@TransLink the stop at 59553 to 22nd is no longer active?... I have to walk all the way to howes and ewen? I have an injury and have to walk that far? Unacceptable.  I expect a solution asap.
@TransLink Skytrain car 053 now leaving Stadium 755 is a mess. Crap everywhere (it’s a Production bound train)
@TransLink I don't understand. Where is the closest stop to get on to get to 22nd at 6am in the pitch black darkness? I can't walk from 59553 to howes/even for the bus in the mornings. I didn't see any other bus stops on my walk to howes/ewen.
@TransLink That's literally garbage. I pay for a monthly pass for transit not to walk.
@translink today is regular service? Last train from waterfront is 1:16?
@TransLink There have been detours but the detours have been 10 seconds away from the regular stop. Not a 5+ minute walk. That's absolutely unacceptable.  What about the people that can't walk that far? The elderly? During the rain? You need a solution.
@TransLink Cool. Thanks!
@TransLink Are downtown buses running on Granville now?
@TransLink When is skytrain maintenance going to end it seems like it’s everyday. It’s really inconvenient for us that work late.
Seriously. Not impressed. First time parking at @yvrairport  Long Term  Parking lot &amp; a horrible experience. My @WestJet flight was delayed &amp; landed after 1:30 AM. @TransLink skytrain was done. And there was no one to guide on where to go. Unnecessary $20 cab ride to parking lot.

"@TransLink thanks to your incompetent drivers that can’t tell time, I’m going to miss my flight. Useless public transport!"
@TransLink what’s up with Lafarge lake Douglas Skytrain? Not moving
@TransLink I am currently waiting for a Millennium line train towards VCC-Clark but there have been none for the last 10 minutes. Was there a delay?
@TransLink Anything up on #millenniumline ? Big crowd on #Lougheed platform and no train times on board.
.@TransLink what’s going on with the Evergreen line this morning?
@TransLink are there delays on Millenium Line wb this morning?  Lougheed station is packed
@TransLink Always delays.
"So where are the millennium line trains, I'm gonna be late for school AGAIN @TransLink"
@TransLink Lougheed station is so crowded right now’!!
@TransLink You better send trains quicker for VCC Clark then because Lougheed is nuts
@TransLink Now attendants telling passengers to get off eastbound #Skytrain at #Lougheed #millenniumline
@TransLink People don’t even have patience when they’re running normally...
"@A_MCCABE_1  Nothing handed in to GVS Adam, email all the details to feedback@translink.co.uk as they may have been left at another station if you travelled on the train.   ^CD"
The Seabus countdown clock is still not working at Waterfront @TransLink maybe Lamar can fix it today?
@TransLink so how late do you think everyone on your trains can be to work on days when your system fails for the millionth time? Why are we still stuck?
"To the lady who saw me run and miss the @translink 101 bus by 5 seconds this morning, and gave me a ride to the next stop to get on it, thank you so much! You rock and cheered me up this morning. 

And 20 minutes later I think I’ve finally caught my breathe."
@TransLink Thanks for making the train move again ?
@TransLink Lougheed is a big stop. Back to backs weren’t enough
@TransLink there's 70 people at brentwood town centre station waiting for the train just wondering but where is it :)
@TransLink WHERE is the skytrain?? Currently at Gilmore for 15 minutes going westbound and zero word from you.
"@TransLink can you confirm status of Train 5, WCE?"
@TransLink where's the millennium line trains?

@TransLink is there a train leaving VCC anytime soon? Commercial Broadway’s really crowded right now. Thanks!
@TransLink it's been 15 minutes at Commercial. How long should I tell my boss I'll be late?
@TransLink Thank you for the quick response! It's a rough morning for all of us today ?
@TransLink Thank you.
"@thecieri_c Sorry, only true @Translink commuters would know ?????"
@TransLink someone has thrown up on the stairs at Bridgeport skytrain  station. Needs clearing up I almost trod in it ?
@TransLink wheres the train to waterfront from Burrard?
@TransLink What happened to the millennium line?
@TransLink When are Burrard escalators due back in service?  2 escalators out at such a busy station is dangerous.
"@translink these sidewalks are for people, not your vehicles. Park on the street like the commoners please! "
@TransLink Will there be back to back train toward LaFarge station as well?
@TransLink hiiii where is the eastbound 250 diverting?
@TransLink Until that happens @Translink kindly get your wheels off of the sidewalk. Safeway has 200 parking stalls less than 50 m away #fedupneighbours #arrogance #publicservice

@TransLink was the 101 bus to lougheed canceled? There was no bus at 8:52 at 6th and 10th st....
All within 10 min walk of a SkyTrain station. @Richmond_BC @TransLink why put the barriers against the grass? You can move it 3 feet and have a sidewalk 
@vanbikecam8 @Richmond_BC @TransLink Richmond is a hot mess of half baked safe infrastructure ideas and nothing in between. Just a complete lack of responsibility by those in power.
@invancouber @vanbikecam8 @Richmond_BC @TransLink Can't wait for it to sink beneath the rising ocean.
@TransLink Can this be prioritized with engineers?  1000s would appreciate if possible. High risk of someone falling.

@TransLink are the Remembrance day compass cards still available for purchase anywhere?
@TransLink Ok thanks.
"@TransLink @gaming_yellow We offer free parking for all guests. All parking at Lougheed is limited to four hours and is exclusively for guest use, therefore if you are parking to ride the SkyTrain, your vehicle is at risk for being towed."
@translink is there a reason the 95 to burrard stn can't stop at granville and Georgia like it has before?huge gap between abbot and burrard stn!
"@TransLink ran to the bus, made eye contact, proceeded to shut the door and take off when I got to the door... Wtf and no I do not want to submit a complaint because that gets me nowhere "

"@TransLink could you please teach the bus drivers that they’re required to stop even if the passenger “is not showing any reactions”?
They just assume cuz you’re not jumping up or waving at them you’re not planning on getting on!
Not everyone has this kind of physical ability!"
@TransLink @BAPs_Girl And some of us 78 can’t stand for long periods
@TransLink what has happen here? 
"@TransLink It really doesn't make any sense, you can't take commuters from the train if you leave before they can get off?"
@TransLink The trolley wires shown in the photo seems screwed up
@TransLink @ParkBoard Hi! Is there any update on this report now that the year is drawing to a close?
@SurreyTraffic Will this add to #502#395s scheduled times?@TransLink
@TransLink what's going on with the 502
@TransLink Any idea where the 3:55 33 is leaving from UBC?
I wish @translink would consider renaming their rapid transit lines to numbers or letters.
@TransLink @ddaaiinnttzz It reminds me of the time when I was stuck at Inlet Centre going to Lincoln and I got stuck with the doors open due to someone walking on the tracks in between Metrotown and Royal Oak but the trains going to VCC-Clark were fine in March 2017 or March 2018
"@TransLink one of your 49 drivers refused to move the bus because it was too full, causing me to miss my connection by a minute! driver was very unprofessional, complained about the situation, &amp; was quite rude"
Hi @TransLink what’s up with the 49? We’ve been waiting a while at the ubc bus loop. Thanks
@TransLink just wondering if you know when the new 3rd platform at Broadway station and entrance and new over head walkway be open last check u said fall 2018 will be open by end of the year?
"lol @TransLink should have constant etiquette reminder for people to remove their backpacks during rush hour, I can’t keep reminding these bitches to"
@TransLink Why is the No. 136 Lougheed Stn bus never on time to its first stop 61803?
"Gotta love what people write on the bus shelters at Haney Place
@TransLink #CleanupMapleRidge "
@TransLink why did the 301 just depart from stop # 56546 a full 5 minutes before this route is scheduled to start? was that bus late from 4:45 or is the 5:00 one still coming?
"I contacted @translink and today received feedback that erroneously claims that I ran a red light!? I'm not even sure if that is possible with this light sequence? I rang to escalate &amp; provide counter evidence, but the only way I can do so is via snail mail! It's 2018 right? 2/3"
"This is the 44 @TransLink ""Express"" bus from UBC to downtown. One every 15 minutes. Lots of people left behind. Atrocious. "
At some point @TransLink needs to face the reality that repairing the Burrard escalators isn’t going to happen and that replacement is the answer.
@TransLink Sometimes it's a double artic bus. Sometimes it's not. Who the fuck knows?
@TransLink So many people still drive to/from UBC because the alternatives are absolute shit.
@TransLink Was discussing with another passenger how making a complaint just gets ignored. Every 15 minutes is not enough. Why would anyone want to stand around outside for 20 minutes for a bus without even a shelter.
"Where's the 319, @TransLink? Supposed to be every 9 mins I've been waiting at 55196 for 25 minutes now! Wtf!"
@TransLink And this bus should *always* be an articulated bus at peak times.
@TransLink anything up with the 503 Aldergrove? Got to stop 55243 at 5:04. Should have been a 5:09 and 5:27. Still here waiting.
"@TransLink 
When in the world is Burrard Skytrain station going to have working escalators. 
One has been under repair for months and the second “down one” has been at a standstill for many weeks. 
Come on!!!!"
@TransLink Thx for the response. Ir happens.
@TransLink There wasn't traffic going that direction...
"@bobr818 @TransLink @BAPs_Girl You can still pay attention for the bus, and try to wave them down."
"@TransLink Fair enough. I know my frustrations should be aimed at our useless politicians, but they really don't seem to care. Because not one of them ever uses transit."
@TransLink What happends? ITS 2 transit security agents un the bus #3 ? #scared #Vancouver #BritishColumbia
"@antmandan @TransLink It's the same fucking light. If you ran red, then the driver is admitting to having run red. I'm sure that isn't true, and he's just making shit up in the hope you go away."
@TransLink Does every train that leaves Lafage Lake Douglas headed for VCC Clark or are some headed just for Lougheed?
@TransLink Thanks. Now do you know why the 123 Northbound is delayed 10 minutes?
i'm so thorsty i might crack open this 2L of cashew milk while i stand in line for the bus... also @TransLink the 106 is late again
@TransLink Canada way and 12th ave
"@TransLink It just arrived luckily, today has been particularly rough commute-wise... I wish there was a way I could make translink improve the 101 bus route, it is so unreliable and doesnt sync up with the 106 at all. It's the only bus that stops in front of my work ):"
"@TransLink Yes I did, thank you"
@TransLink 3 41 busses passed willow at 41st ave and switched to Not In Service. Is there a reason for this??
@TransLink Ok. Thanks TM!
"Hey @TransLink , did you at least try to get this person some mental health assistance before taking their money and slapping a disclaimer on it? "
.@TransLink
@TransLink so we all wait here at the New West station with the 123 late again and a lineup 2 blocks long. Why IS IT SO HARD TO HAVE A BUS ON TIME HERE!!
@TransLink Got a friend to pick up because it was taking too long. Willow and 41st Ave. What do you mean by short turned?
@TransLink  26 minute wait and going. Seen two 123 buses already come to this station but none have come by bay 4. Any of these 3 gonna pick us up? Thanks. 
@TransLink Sitting at Broadway stn for 5 minutes. Train not moving. No announcements????

"@TransLink The content of the ad isn't the problem. The problem is that ""targeted individuals"" are people with mental health issues (often schizophrenia), and these sort of groups are harmfully reinforcing their delusions and actively discouraging people from getting the help they need."

"@TransLink Also, I just want to say that it's entirely possible someone from your organization did try and reach out to the person buying the ad, but they simply refused any assistance (which is, sadly, very common with paranoia). Good on you if that's the case."

@TransLink No.

@TransLink what’s happening with the expo line tonight
@TransLink we were told this train was out of service but then they changed their mind...

@TransLink Atleast someone should put something that's it not in service otherwise people keep waiting in that area
@TransLink why didnt the 314 bus heading eastbound to kg show up at 6:26 AM this morning - on the tracker and then disappears. shit service every 30 minutes if that....10+ people on these stops relying on service but nothing during this heavy rain morning
@TransLink just wondering why the 502 didn’t show up at Surrey central
@translink driver of bus B9639 arriving at Metrotown station blocks the cross walk at the drop off point again. Butts his bus against the bus that dropped the 110 off. We can't cross safely through the crosswalk. People forced to get to Skytrain by walking around the bus
@translink - where are the eaatbound buses on the Fraser Highway (at 156??
@bchydro @NEWS1130 Loud bang about 28 minutes ago while everyone was waiting on the platform at Surrey Central - all the lights went out also @TransLink
Seriously @TransLink ...stop taking trains out of service...especially during the busiest transit times. Kthxbai.
@TransLink 502 At stop 55235 hasn't arrived. 7:21 and 7:28 are MIA
@TransLink what’s up with the 210 bus from Lynn Valley this am?!!

@TransLink please turn off the heat. Train car 422. Expo to waterfront. It’s so stuffy and hot
@TransLink What about surrey central. No elevator and no power to the escalators? No information given either.
@TransLink It was at tower road by SFU. the bus showed up at 7:37

@TransLink This is ridiculous.. two buses showed up the same.. there should be something done to notify the riders so we don’t just bluntly wait for extra 30+ in the cold

"@TransLink A detour shouldn't take &gt;30mins...why can't you adjust departure times to offset the delay? People have schedules, you have excuses"

I should clarify that it's the post-8 am out of the SS Park and Ride that you often have to wait through 2 or 3 buses to get on one."
@TransLink so the bus arrived at 834…that's the regular arrival time for the bus after the 821…is the earlier bus got cancelled?

"@TransLink Actually I see an alert about the 8:40 and the 8:50 being cancelled, but nothing about the 9 or the 9:15 being cancelled. Or anything about the 9:35 bus departing at 9:30 which is when it actually did. Not asking for tweets for everything just some sort of #notice. Thanks."
"@TransLink hi, thanks to the B-line driver for stranding a bunch of us on 10th on the reroute b/c of the accident. The one that just passed at Blanca westbound."
@Translink_NI My suggestion is that you begin by reinstating the 10.15 train from Great Victoria Street on the Larne line. Would you please make the relevant people aware of my tweets. The last time I emailed feedback it was two weeks before I received a full reply. Thanks.
@TransLink hey is there something up with the 640 going to Scott rd ? The 10:20 bus is no show.
@TransLink 55033
@TransLink It also came after I tweeted you it was 16 mins late this not the first time it has been that late or a no show it’s always that time slot I try not to catch it at that time
@TransLink K sounds good
@TransLink there's been accident right at the intersection of Fraser Highway amd 160th Street in surrey. Will bus 502 be delayed at stop # 55243?
@CBCVancouver Zero. Right now you can get a (transit) ride from Vancouver to Hope for about ten bucks. I wish for more of that. @TransLink @BCTransit 
@TransLink @BCTransit Well that’s just a straight up lie. Cuz I sat thru 15 minutes of “now”.
@TransLink When the elevator and escalator will be back in service?
@TransLink Thank you DA ??
@cknw @steeletalk @TransLink Why are JWs allowed to stand outside the Skytrain stations advertising their religion? Are other religious groups allowed to do so? Do they pay money to Translink for permission to be on the property?
"Yo, Why do people always say thank you to the @TransLink bus driver? Him/Her ain’t dropping you off at the front door free of charge..."
@TransLink Ty. 5 bus showed up shortly after my tweet
"We are lucky to have so many kind, patient &amp; helpful bus drivers in Vancouver. Kudos to our #5 driver eastbound at 1:30 today for going beyond the call of duty to help an elderly man. @TransLink @UniforTheUnion"
@TransLink where's the 1:31 373 bus at stop 55789?
@TransLink I asked if the SkyTrain cars we stopping or passing through the Station because of the power outage
@TransLink i saw an umbrella on the bench at bus stop....53477 I think. It’s at Austin Avenue and Hillcrest Street. Was on the bus when I saw it
"@TransLink I just thought that since there was a power outage, the tracks wouldn't have power to stop the trains"
@TransLink Will the skytrain rail maintenance still start at 9:30pm tonight even with the Fleetwood Mac concert at @RogersArena
@TransLink @RogersArena thank you :)
@TransLink No 9 boundary at commercial station?? Long line of understandably frustrated people.

"Hey @TransLink - how long does it take to fix the escalators and elevators?? Seems to be a problem at every single station.  The elderly, mothers with strollers and persons with various disabilities would appreciate some action #transitfail"
@TransLink is the 7 that was supposed to come a couple mins ago at 50435 coming?? It says ‘now’ on the next bus schedule but there’s no bus on the map. What happened to it?
@Translink please sort out your 354 afternoon route!!! Passengers waiting for 5:20 bus while there's one bus on break at Bridgeport?!? Bus is consistently late ?
@TransLink I told you he’s soooo into the Skytrain... 
@TransLink @Translink the 5:20 534 was a no show again! Agitated passengers on 5:35 bus ?
"You can barely see it but someone was doing the Pythagorean theorem on this bus window @translink 3 main bus 2553 @ Vancouver, British Columbia "
@TransLink and now the next 7 that was on the schedule and GPS just went by marked Not In Service. I’ve been here for 30 mins now!! What is going on!?
@TransLink what’s going on with the sky train at water front?
@TransLink And the bus that was scheduled to come before that and never did....? Bus finally came- I’ve been waiting since 4:10.
"@TransLink @jza83 Might be referencing the ‘no trains anywhere for 10+ minutes’ and a packed platform I assume? Caught the first train that came and only a handful people could get on at Burrard, nobody got on at Granville and the platform is packed. There are usually 3 or 4 trains in that span..."
@TransLink I got on a train at Joyce station that said it was going to King George. I look up to see we are heading to Sapperton Station! It switched on me somewhere along the line. 2 other people said the same thing. What's up?
"@TransLink My husband catches the same bus everyday. The 342 Newton exchange that leaves Langley at 4:38pm. Yesterday and today the bus left Langley at least 5 minutes early. This is NOT ok! He takes the 342 then the 301, and as it was he was having to wait for the 301 at 6:08pm."
@TransLink Now he's stuck waiting even longer to get home all because a driver didn't wanna wait until his scheduled departure time.
@TransLink No. But it was the same one that had a car not being used due to door issues at the rear of the train. The train before it was also a Production Way train so having two in a row makes no sense
"@TransLink There is vomit at Kootenay Loop Bay 3 beside the benches, I’ve noticed it there yesterday too."
"@TransLink the 95 detour says ongoing, so we don’t know the date for it to go back to regular route?"
"@TransLink So for tomorrow morning, it will stop at Granville street as usual? Today it stopped at Abbott and then Georgia."
@TransLink @jza83 This wasn’t a brief delay. Commute will be longer because I can’t catch my bus now.
"@TransLink the 5:10 601 is 9 minutes late, again. The line is at least two busloads long. Why does this bus neeem to rarely come on time? "
@TransLink Hey what’s going on with the Tsawwassen buses? No 602 at 5:20 and now no 604 at 5:30? When can we expect a bus to arrive?
"@TransLink you know you have two sides to the king George station right? You should stop making both inbound and outbound traffic use the single side with an out of commission escalator. Really, and it's slower when you just use one side. Would love to know why you do this"
@TransLink do you treat for bedbugs? I just saw them on the window of a 10 bus going south on Granville...
@TransLink 5:38pm 640 bus from Scott road station never came?? Why tho
@TransLink @ybabic72 haha my school was affected by the power outage. Never knew the skytrain went out too
"@translink could I develop a marketing communication strategy to educate rush hour bus riders to more effectively utilize bus space? SkyTrain doesn't seem to suffer those challenges as much thankfully. 
Yours truly,
An Asian transit user"
"@TransLink I stand corrected-there is an elevator at Burrard but is so obscure &amp; out of the way that most people probably don’t know it’s there. 
Suggest putting out A-frame boards all over reminding where the elevators are. 
Please answer on when the two escalators will be operational"
@TransLink ?????
"Y’all. My @TransLink driver just sang “You’ve Lost That Lovin Feeling” as “You’ve lost that personal space, woahhh cause its rush hour...” and boy did it make my Wednesday ?"
"@cbcnewsbc God, I hope this will eventually replace the Newton Exchange line as well. @TransLink desperately needs this."
"hey @TransLink the 106 is late again, per my text to 33333 trying to find scheduled times it said it would come at 6:09 and that one never showed at all. Getting really tired of my commute increasing by half an hour or more because this bus can't stick to schedule."
@TransLink this seems to be a trend at this stop. I'd expect better service from transit in a busy city centre but this is backwoods Langley-level unreliability.
@TransLink Is Surrey Central elevator back in service or not?

@TransLink any idea why 4/5 Lafarge Lake Douglas came without any Expo Line to Waterfront at Production Way skytrain station!!??
"The 301 is always late, and the driver pulled up to the station and told the people waiting to catch the next bus. Not full. Because he was 'running behind'? Frustrating. @TransLink"
@TransLink where are the 319 buses...? The line up is 3/4 buses long.. leaving from scott road station(sorry cant see the id #)
@TransLink is the 7 on its normal route or has it been rerouted?
@TransLink a train on the Expo line stopped abruptly today approach 29th Stn causing some people to fall.  Why didn’t someone check on passengers?
@TransLink I have to wait 30 sometimes 60 minutes due to who knows what some days and this bus comes within 5 minutes of each other? BRUUUtal! I know this bus comes 3x faster then the 430 Metrotown but come on you guys! Get with it and correct this! 
@TransLink It was the train that was taken out of service at Main station this morning.
@TransLink please turn heat off train car 205. Expo line. It’s cooking my legs.
@TransLink is the 180 at 7.02 from 61891 cancelled tonight or is it just the driver taking her time on the phone?
"@TransLink Detour definitely still in place, main and king Edward is blocked off"
@TransLink No I was off the bus when I sent it. I got on at SB Granville at Nelson at 5:26. They were mid bus on the left side along the window.
@TransLink Thanks
@TransLink hello! To@or row I need to be at the airport by 12:30 pm. My start location is the south surrey bus loop. Directions please.
"@TransLink I think there's a mess of some sort on the Canada Line, car 110, at the front. Not sure what it is but folks aren't sitting down. First door, right side."
"Kudos to @translink driver driving 20 Victoria SB at Commercial and Broadway at 9:55PM tonight for his act of kindness to slow down just enough to help someone who was running to catch his bus.

Didn’t catch bus no, but he had an Aussie? Accent.  

I told him it was a nice deed."
"@TransLink Done!

Thanks!  

Have a great night!"
"@bcndp really dragging its ass n pandering to the taxi companies n @TransLink, which BTW both suck"
@TransLink Nothing like waiting 35 minutes in the rain!!! I watched 7 buses drive by saying they're not in service. An absolutely joke from translink. We the public pay for your service and its possibly one of the worst transit systems I've seen
@sydflo9 @TransLink SHE WENT AWFFFF! GO AWF SIS!
"What's the ETA on fixing real-time bus info, @TransLink ?"
@TransLink Well there's a bunch of us waiting for a southbound 20 at 50963 who could have benefitted from knowing the just SUPER frequency every 15 min bus would be skipping the 11pm coach
"@TransLink As much as I so enjoy this nostalgia-filled trip back to my childhood in Surrey in the 80s and 90s, would be great if we could, you know, go back to 2008 and see when the buses were going to arrive"
@TransLink Thank you for all your hard work in some trying times...
@TransLink I HATE U SO MUCH! It’s sunday 12:20AM and I can’t take train back home to van from new west?! Really? You’re a joke to my money that I spend on U

@TransLink morning. Just seeing if the first 7 of the morning is on its way? Stop 50397.
@TransLink Ok thanks for the response. Yes no bus yet.
@TransLink can I get a confirmation that the wristbands will be sold today? 
@TransLink Can you do a thorough investigation as to why the service on the 106 has decreased in quality since the original line was split in two? I’ve been waiting for over 30 mins for a bus at 52447...
Under-appreciated benefit of the Canada Line and @TransLink in general: you don’t have to scrape it on frosty mornings. 
@TransLink  how come real-time bus information is not available these days?
"I’m thoroughly and extremely disappointed with the service of the 106 bus. What I hoped should have been a planned 45 minute trip to Downtown instead turned into a 45 minute trip from my house to the bus stop and back. @TransLink, you can do much better than that."
@rwdettman @TransLink @NEWS1130Traffic @NEWS1130Weather And pro tip... you really shouldn’t try.
"@TransLink dont worry about the weather, the homeless all warm up on the buses anyway"
@llikemoyd @rwdettman @TransLink @NEWS1130Traffic @NEWS1130Weather Speaking from experience?
Hey there @TransLink where do we go for the 84 this morning? Not at VCC Clark bay 1? Across the street somewhere?
@Sheila_Scott @CTVVancouver @CTVMorningLive @TransLink @TransLink should be dealing with the bus almost gotta people killed when the bus driver stopped on the middle of the highway just 10 mins ago headed to the ferry B8071
"@TransLink Please remember, drivers should dress for the weather, we are crammed on skytrains &amp; buses with coats on, no need to crank the heat to max. Thank you."
@TransLink @Sheila_Scott @CTVVancouver @CTVMorningLive time to start training the Bus drivers more because the bus driver missed the turn off he parked the bus on the middle of the highway almost getting people killed if a semi came along. i am glad a passenger   on the bus got us to the ferry helping the bus driver
"Love the staff at @TransLink WCE customer service office, taking photos of the massive line-up for #Compass wristbands: ""We need to have a sense of humour, it's all we've got."" &lt;3"
@TransLink Lineup up and down the halls! 
"@TransLink Busses late or cancelled from multiple hubs, other reoccurring problems, fare increase. Doesn’t make much sense."
@TransLink where is the WB 33 that was meant to leave stop 51818 at 7:04am?
"@TransLink on CTV showing three wrist bands, blue orange and black for employees but no explanation someone missed the boat (bus)"
"@TransLink Never mind, here it is"
2000 @translink Compass wristbands are available TODAY in Vancouver  
@VIAwesome @TransLink What a great idea.
7:12 153 53321 where?  @TransLink
@TransLink insane! 
"@TransLink am unable to travel this morning. I loaded my monthly pass last night, but it has not registered yet. When I got on the bus it deducted $ and I’m now at a negative balance and can’t get on the train. Compass is telling me I have to clear the balance first. WTF?"
@TransLink That is where I started. I did not have a negative balance until I tapped on the bus this morning. And now I can’t get on the train. Compass will not help - they say I must clear the balance (there should be no balance - I have a pass) before I can access the train.
"@TransLink So, I’m just stranded here then?"
@TransLink once again 406 leaving us in the dust... Early again...
@TransLink I agree. Compass insists I must put an additional $1.05 on my card to clear the negative balance that their system created.
@TransLink whose great idea was it to release a limited quantity of the compass bracelets and not limit quantities for purchase!?
A huge lineup just to get a better transit product - a wrist band Compass Card - oh why oh why did @TransLink only produce such a limited amount? 
Not anymore - there are enough people in line at both Stadium &amp; Waterfront stations that we (closer to the back of the lineup) have been advised there may not be enough for all who are here already...
"TransLink launches project to replace 1980s-era signs &amp; audio: Real-time info, new displays and upgraded sound at 33 stations @TransLink  -  #BritishColumbia #Transit"
"If it saves you one second per tap using the new wristband, how long will it take to break even on this lineup?"
@TransLink any update on the release of the compass bracelets?
So thankful I pooped before coming out here
There better be compass wristbands when I get to stadium station.......I woke up early for a reason lol @TransLink
"This is cool, but probably not for me. I'm not interested in multiple wearables (Fitbit/watch plus this). Would be best if TransLink could also introduce the ability to load passes on Google/Apple pay."
@TransLink has the schedule for bus 180 at North Road and Foster Ave changed? This is the second consecutive Monday and the bus scheduled to arrive at 7:51 am didn’t show up
@Dale_Bracewell @TransLink I just went by the queue and gave up.
@TransLink I hope you’re limiting the number of wristbands each person can buy
@TransLink Is there a line-up?
@TransLink hi. I’m at stop 56610. Where’s 8:03 403? Thanks.
Line-up at the @TransLink Stadium office to buy #Compass wristbands. Goes down the block. 
@TransLink 1000 units of adult bracelet I’m guessing all spoken for with this line

"O Hai, SeaBus Owl! Nice work @TransLink ? "

@TransLink I’m on the bus now but 15-10 minutes later than I expected. The only thing I’m waiting for is to find out exactly how late I’ll be.
"Line up for compass bracelet down the blocck, wanted one but got a job to get to... people coming out with 5-6 of them. Mostly students. Sounds like I will not be getting one?@translink "
"@TransLink Thanks for your patience, CK. Yes, the agent could see it, but insisted that I pay-not interested in helping me. I paid, then called again when I arrived at work; different agent, reversed the charge &amp; explained that if 1st tap on a pass is on a bus, it often won't register."
@TransLink Is the plan to start selling the Compass Card wristbands online via the Translink store?
"“In a North American first, @TransLink will be offering a wearable payment option for customers.

Compass wristbands, which will work the same as a Compass Card, will allow the rider to tap in and tap out when travelling on transit.”

"@TransLink could you please provide better training to drivers about what constitutes a ""full"" bus? Multiple buses have driven past this morning with ample space in the rear of the bus. Fraser and Broadway gets skipped a lot!"
@TransLink whose brilliant idea was it to release only 2000 wristbands? Waking up early and lining up for nothing on a Monday morning was the perfect start to my week?

@TransLink So we can’t call 604-398-2042 to get one?
one of your gates at burquitlam is majorly freaking out @TransLink
"Massive lineups outside the Stadium-Chinatown SkyTrain station as @TransLink sells 2,000 Compass wristbands in a North American first. Some, who were in line for hours this morning, telling us it was worth the wait to have a more convenient way to tap in and tap out. "
@TransLink Exactly
"@TransLink This means whoever got told ""1,000 is plenty, no one wants them"" gets to do the 'I Told You So' dance."
@TransLink it’s amazing the popularity of the wristband but I hope you will compensate these folks standing waiting for the wristband 
@MiddyBot @TransLink i put one around my cack
@TransLink So they are sold out a both places?
@TransLink Even the concession ones?
"@TransLink Please order more than 1,000 of each next time."
@TransLink It was always labeled as a test. With a limited release. ?
@TransLink I know but i was asking if they were sold out at both places
@TransLink And if they’d have ordered 5000 and they didn’t sell you’d be complaining Translink did know what they’re doing. How do they win

Also, why not just do what I do, and have your card inside your phone case?"

@ctv_jon @JillFDrews @TransLink I wonder how many of these wrist bands are now for sale on Craigslist? They should have limited it to one band for every compass card you have.
@translink will those wristbands eventually come out of vending machines like the cards do?
@beautifulpigeon @NeetuGarcha @GlobalBC @TransLink I feel like these bracelets are actually worse somehow than the hot dog water.  Just seeing those huge crowds.  It's so sad.

@DuranEstefania_ @TransLink I didn't even know these existed but is there a compelling reason @TransLink couldn't sell these online?

@TransLink Just wondering could I trade in my Compass card for a wristband? Only thing is that my card needed no initial deposit.
This was taken about half hour ago. People taking a chance and hoping to get their hands on Compass Card wristbands even though @Translink said adult passes sold out. Some people still walking out with them after waiting upwards of 1.5hrs. 
"Huge lineups as @TransLink Compass wristbands sell out in one hour

@ybrend @BCTransit @GavinBamber @TransLink Thanks
I'm a little surprised by this. Maybe we see ORCA wristbands in the Seattle area in the near future?
@ybrend @BCTransit @BlairKing_ca @TransLink Awesome!! Media should report this!!
@CstJPonsioen should watch out for his @translink compass band. Sounds like they are a hot commodity on the mean streets of Vancouver . Question every high five from now on and stay vigilant !
@NeetuGarcha @TransLink 
"@mckayspencer @TransLink That's a good question. It could be because it was a limited release. Also, those who wanted to transfer the funds from their regular Compass card to the wristband were told they could only do it in person."
"@a_gossweiler @grescoe @modacitylife You have no idea what you're talking about.

Off the top of my head
- The @TransLink SkyTrain in Vancouver has almost half a million trips every day, not bad for a city with a population under 650k.
-Toronto's @TTChelps has a daily ridership over 2 million, or 1 in 13 Canadians."
@TransLink Any concession left?
"@TransLink Freezing my butt off waiting for my Compass card to register the $95 I fed it more than an hour ago.  They warn you it can take 'up to' two hours during busy times, so fair enough, but seriously. Maybe y'all can ask Starbucks' how they manage to make their cards work?"
That's gotta be the line up for Jam! People actually want these?
"@Rogue951 @NEWS1130 @TransLink Yes, it was a limited release of 2,000 wristbands (1,000 adult and 1,000 concession). But some at the line said TransLink should have known they were going to be so popular and order more in advance. Some will now have to wait until February, or longer, to get their hands on one."
@DuranEstefania_ @TransLink Fair enough. But arguably a presale would've let them better judge numbers and then people could have come at their convenience to transfer money. Having disabled persons queue up in early December seems non ideal.
@sklazinga @grescoe @modacitylife @TransLink @TTChelps Sounds good. But what will you do when you're in Montreal and want to visit the Railroad Museum in Dorval or some flea market in the outskirts? There is no public transport. You have to to there by bicycle which is very dangerous.
@TransLink so the 101 leaving 22nd St Stn at 1:40 is still just sitting there. The driver's been in it the whole time. What's going on??
"@TransLink I'll bet you that $95 the card starts working *exactly two hours* after you charged my credit card, and not a minute before. Even though 12:27 on a Monday three days into the month ain't a 'busy period'. ?"

@TransLink Thanks for the update.
@TransLink i see the 104 from 22nd st has had some delays (again). However policy of only starting buses at 22nd st on time not working as no buses since 5:50. Yet there have been loads “not in service” couldn’t one of them become the 6:07 or 6:24. Cold outside and homes to go to
@TransLink I think is more than 30 minutes! I've been here since 5:51pm. This happens almost every week.

"@TransLink Thanks I understand that, but my frustration is that unless it is the scheduled time at 22nd st no bus will leave, so if a bus is delayed by congestion that means the people are waiting longer as no bus can show outside scheduled time. Why couldn’t the bus just be late?"
@TransLink there are 4 parked busses here and a driver that seems to be waiting on the 104 to arrive. can’t a replacement be arranged ?

What’s going on with broadway/commercial b-line? No busses &amp; massive lines @TransLink?
"@chrismbryan @TransLink OK, I have a really really dumb question. Since skytrain cars drive in both directions, how do I know which is the front right door?  Wouldn't there be 2? One when it's east bound, one when it's westbound?"

@TransLink anything up with the 14? Been waiting at 50320 since 8:05 and two scheduled busses have no showed so far. Should I catch a 9 instead?

"@_JoelGibbs @TransLink @abundanttransit Long-term planning could perhaps focus on spreading the TODs onto other corridors (I heard the M-Line still has plenty room for growth), developing new urban job centres (e.g. Surrey Central) and bringing more housing close to jobs."
@Itsamanthing56 @TransLink @GlobalBC Pathetic!!!!!

A winter without @TransLink's real-time NextBus is starting to look miserable. I feel bad for their twitter staff as well as bus rider like myself who don't know where our buses are... Hopefully it'd be fixed before the first drop of snow.
@ctv_jon @TransLink The problem is the platforms are too short. Longer platforms mean more cars to help disperse the crowd.
@SurreyIsTheBomb @TransLink why don’t you look at including a budget line to prevent frost and ice from stopping transit?
"@acemacg @TransLink It’s cheaper to deal with it on the few days a year that it occurs, however inconvenient to the ridership."

"@TransLink Thanks, it would have been nice if your website (or twitter) mentioned that. It's pretty cold outside especially when you are standing around waiting for a bus that never shows. Bus finally arrived..."
@TransLink @GlobalBC Whew! Finally! It’s been a huge headache. Esp when you have to catch connections and the bus leaves early. #stranded
@TransLink Thanks for the info. I was using 'next bus' and there were no alerts listed there. I will add the noted website  for future reference and will also subscribe. :)
@TransLink I dropped my Compass card on the 246 bus (departed downtown at 6:34). If you find it let me know!

@TransLink Do you have any update as when the Surrey Central elevator back in service?
"@TransLink hey there! Do you have an idea of why both my much utilized before and after work bus stop benches have been removed? (Fremont at Sherling northbound and Lougheed at Shaughnessy eastbound). Perhaps, will they be improved on return? "
Compass wristbands ???
@TransLink Just curious... Why do you guys only run 2 car 2002 Mark II's on the Millennium Line now?
"@TransLink Ok. I am actually typically fond of the 2002 Mark II's because I like the white colour scheme. However I prefer seeing them on the Expo Line because they are 4 cars, and 4 car trains look better and allow more room for passengers. ^zw"

"@kevkcw22 @TransLink @abundanttransit It is in the process of being upgraded (new trains, station renos to improve flow and capacity, hydro upgrades, etc). The max build-out capacity is 25k pphpd, and in 2014, @TransLink knew we would be at that capacity by about 2040.  1/3"
@TwoRails @TransLink Hurrah!
"@kevkcw22 @TransLink @abundanttransit Ridership has grown significantly above projection since 2014, and if current rate continues, likely mid-2030's for 25k pphpd ridership. There is severe overcrowding in peak now (capacity is beyond the 15K now due to 6 car MkI trains and other changes since Evergreen opening) 2/3"
"@kevkcw22 @TransLink @abundanttransit Here's the link to details, see page 25: 

3/3 "
"@kevkcw22 @TransLink @abundanttransit Even including all upgrades to 25k pphpd capacity, Expo line will still be at/over capacity by mid-2030s or 2040 latest, based on 2014 Expo upgrade projections. Hence the pressing need to start planning alternatives immediately."

@TransLink hey so the Millennium platform at Commercial is full and there was a substantial number of passengers that couldn’t make it on this stuffed train. If you could just send that 6 car Mark I train sitting at VCC-Clark that would be great....
@TransLink and you’re welcome in advance. It’s already shoulder to shoulder and we still managed to fit a gentleman with a wheelchair at Renfrew. 10 minute frequency on the Millennium Line is unacceptable if passengers are being left behind.
"@kevkcw22 @TransLink @abundanttransit Onto other transit corridors, yes, but also across vast low density SFD areas in the region. We need to provide good service everywhere, and sadly (or not), that means not Skytrain due to the high costs preventing widespread rail transit. 14km Subway to UBC $$ = ~80-110km LRT $$"

@TransLink what happened to the 373 at 55801? Saw one go not in service and a lot of people just got on my bus
.@TransLink the old expo line trains are garbage. They are literally the same trains from Expo86. During rush hour they are useless. Either get rid of them or refurbish them and take half the seats out. #vancouver #skytrain #rushhour #translink
Three b99 come at the same time. Cause that makes sense. @TransLink
@TransLink I didn't .just checking...
@TransLink Any idea why I’ve been waiting 25 mins plus for a bus on Kingsway and the one that just pulled by didn’t pick up?
@TransLink You guys need to find a solution to wait times for the 6. It's not reliable. People either wait 15+ mins for it or 2 come at a time. It's rush-hour and it's the only bus route for us. #disappointed #late #notefficient
@TransLink 51194. It is now 30 mins I’ve been waiting. This is ridiculous on a sub-zero morning.
@TransLink get on the 17 around 6:45 bus is late so the next 17 is behind it. after a few stops the driver decides to stop and let the other 17 and several NIS buses pass. let your riders know you don't honor the schedule so we can transfer to a responsible driver
@TransLink please make sure busses are actually full before passing stops. The #6 that just passed stop 50636 had the entire back of the bus open.
@MayorStewart Is there plan for @TransLink to switch to 4 car train on M-Line. Train from coquitlam got crowded after Lincoln. Standing room only
Morning @TransLink the 351 bus I was on this morning broke down on 99...but I want to thank the driver for trying to get us as far as he did AND thank the driver of the 604 for picking us all up and getting us safely to Bridgeport.

"One lady told me she had missed three trains in a row because there was no room. I love public transit but get it together, @TransLink."
@TransLink bus 052 running the no2 route just asked a wheelchair passenger to wait for the next bus instead of asking people to move. There was enough room for them to stand.
@TransLink is the 402 Brighouse coming? It was suppose to arrive at stop #56533 6 minutes ago. We're all out here freezing in -3 weather.
Here’s another issue the NDP denies. @Uber @lyft drop off/pick up at end of transit line thereby encouraging transit use. Others may not want/or can’t walk those distances so would take their car. We need @ridesharingnow to increase @TransLink use #northvan #westvan

could somebody please tell the 49 UBC bus driver that just left 49th ave and victoria drive that he was very nice and i missed his joke and feel bad about it! ive had him as a driver before. super nice. @TransLink
@amtayl @TransLink The people who made this decision when it was built are long gone
Yesterday’s 15 at 50467 comes right at 0705 (On time) and here I am today still waiting for it... @TransLink
@TransLink There always seems to be a “mechanical issue” for the 705 bus. Is there something that could be done for these buses that people this early rely on? PLUS it’s also freezing and now I’m late for work.
@TransLink AND! If I wanted the 722 then I would have left my home earlier.
@TransLink is the Reindeer Bus in Burnaby today? Is it the 101 from Lougheed Town Center. Thanks!
"So, a bunch of us retired @TransLink supervisors are getting together for #Christmas coffee and snacks at a friend's house this morning.  #TransitFamilyCamaraderieLivesForever"
@TransLink This 28 bus sits for 15+ minutes only 30 feet from the stop every day for the past 2 weeks with no bus driver in sight... Could we encourage bus drivers to pull up to the stop and leave the doors open so passengers can board and get out of the chilling through draft? 
@TransLink Thank you !
@TransLink so the escalators @ King George have been 'under construction' for over 3 weeks now. When is that getting fixed?
@TransLink they're calling for lots of rain today. Are we going to have a repeat of yesterday? It took me an extra 2 hours to get home yesterday
@TransLink I guess the answer was yes then.... ? 
@TransLink #49 bus (R8011) needs maintenance work. Far rear passenger-side wheel rubbing in wheel well. May be a shock issue. Causing intermittent smell of burning of rubber. Just arrived at ubc bus loop
"@TransLink @layzee_bones It is NOT the drivers recovery time it IS schedule recovery, in the event of a delay it run can complete the trip and still leave as scheduled."

@TransLink Why are no buses going south on Granville and should we go to Howe?
@TransLink Wonderful.  As a side note I always appreciated the history of the tunnel.  Please pass on my thanks to the SkyTrain team for there top notch work.  Have a great evening. :)
"@TransLink @CrawGraeme please...

as @CrawGraeme said this is not the first time. my first email was in the summer and most recently last week

save your efforts to soothe us with words and provide some action"
@TransLink I was waiting at 22nd street since 5:30. A bus finaly showed up at 6:22.
"??WIFI ON @TransLink !?? 

Rollout starting in 2020 -- with the entire network of busses, Skytrains, and Seabusses to be connected by 2025.  ?? #bcpoli #transit /@TransLink"
@TransLink @akajtg I understand there was an incident but at 4pm you tweeted that the route was back to running regular route. This implies that it is also running to schedule. If a delay was expected then the tweet should have made it clear that it was possible some delays could occur
"@kris_sims Yup.  Isn't @TransLink simply the best?

"
Should @Translink seek funding and support to prioritize WIFI on the full transit network PRIOR to 2025?
"@TransLink I was at north van on marine drive , the bus got full fast there’s a lot of people waiting stilñ"

@TransLink #WCE has always been advertised as a premier service,  why is it not going there the same time as the bus or skytrain service?  ?
"
@jensaltman @j_mcelroy @TransLink Interesting. I’d rather have my Shaw bill reduced. If they can afford to provide this service for “free”. They must have a crap load of extra cash kicking around.
@TransLink Thanks so much! Could see something from the stop at Drake but wasn't sure whether to go further north on Granville or onto Howe to get a bus (but did get one).
"@NEWS1130 @TransLink Yay!!! Let’s make people more likely to ignore others, less likely to make eye contact and smile and be less responsive. Chiropractor’s are lining up for the sore necks from all the riders looking at their stupid phones."
@TransLink Was this message actually passed on to your drivers? Because I’m on Granville bridge and now we’re stuck because my driver went straight and we’re sandwiches between two buses with nowhere to go.
@TransLink This tweet was sent out 16 mins ago long before my bus got here. The announcement is useless if your drivers don’t know it. Now I’m about to walk down the bridge in the rain.
"@TransLink My bus driver has no notification on his system to tell him to make this detour, so now we have a line of buses stuck. Please send the notification out so other buses don’t get stuck too. "
"@TransLink @ShawInfo Yup late as usual.  Should have been rolled out years ago. Good ole Translink, miles behind other transit systems in every way in North America. What an absolute embarrassment."
@TransLink I saw an orange light on train 250
@TransLink Are they still detoured north on Seymour?
@TransLink We were sitting there for at least 10 minutes before I finally got off the bus and he still had no notification whatsoever. In fact I believe he still stuck there now. I read him your tweet to detour and he almost didn’t even believe me because they weren’t notified.
@TransLink When is the next bus at stop #56898
@TransLink Thank you for all the hard work. ??
"@NEWS1130 @TransLink If it’s anything like Shaw Open, don’t bother its crap ?"
Honestly @TransLink announcing WiFi across their whole system is the best thing that happened to me LOL. Now I don't have to use up all my data xd.

"Thank you Mayor @jonathancote, for making my @translink 105 bus to @myuptown arrive on time! #newwest"
@TransLink @ShawInfo Perhaps an app that will show people on their screen the stops so there's at least a chance people will awaken? Buzz or light up when your stop is close?
"Reddit poster says they reported it to TransLink around 6:10 pm, but no one from customer service seems to know anything or on the Transit Police line. Please help, @TransLink"
"@TransLink Yes I did. It gave me 7:14 and 7:20, etc as times that it would be passing that stop"

This will add all of the Shaw Mobi Bikes and Shaw Go Zones in Vancouver parks as free hot spots.  The question that should be asked is what is Shaw doing with your data? There's no free ride.
@TransLink I found prescription medication for asthma. Please retweet ... This medication was just bought today. He might need it badly. I tried to contact the MarMar pharmacy but they are closed already. It is for a male patient. 
Just got on a new bus and it seems quite awkwardly designed. What is this part for? It gets in the way of your legs @TransLink People don't know where to put their feet. 
@TransLink Thanks. I just called for a ride. Just wanted to get home
@TransLink Thanks just got on it.
"When road pricing comes into effect (oh, it’s a‘comin’!) use all that new road congestion tax money to fund improved and free transit. Free transit is guaranteed to get people out of their cars and onto a bus. We follow our pocketbooks! #NorthVan"

@TransLink I contacted the command center of Canada line and they send an attendant to pick up the medication already. Thanks.

Surrey mayor Doug McCallum at ?@TransLink? mayors’ council meeting suggests Westcoast Express be expanded ‘out to the valley’ and also says more water transit should be included in future transit planning ?@CKNW? ?@GlobalBC? ?@TransLink? ? 
"To better connectivity almost everywhere! @TransLink will bring free WiFi to buses, #SkyTrain and #Seabus by 2020. "
"Now @TransLink staff moving onto the big point of this meeting: SkyTrain in #SurreyBC and #LangleyBC. Here's what they'll be reviewing generally in terms of South of the Fraser rapid transit planning.
@BlackPressMedia "
Hey @TransLink next #240 at #54448
"I'm sure you're aware of a ""3 for 1"" deal! The new #SurreyBC rapid transit project is basically 1 for the cost of 3 ?  #SurreyLRT @TransLink "
Good to see @SanyZein at the @TransLink @mayors_council Meeting. #transit #SkyTrain #SurreyBC #Transportation #interurbanrailway #translink
@TransLink where your 240’s at
@CstJPonsioen @TransitPolice @TransLink Oh what great pics!
"Let's refresh our memories re: funding.
Currently, $1.65B is approved for LRT + @TransLink will have to submit new business case to swap senior govt funding to SkyTrain.
Full 16kms of Fraser Hwy SkyTrain est. to cost $2.9B (vs $1.9B LRT), but nothing approved.
@BlackPressMedia"
"Imagine being able to get on a train in Langley City and get off the train at the University of British Columbia! We will be the envy of cities in North America with an extensive rapid transit system where trains arrive every few minutes, 96% on time, all the time. ?"
"In total, South of the Fraser rapid transit (LRT, SkyTrain, B-Line all options) is supposed to cost $3.5B. #SurreyBC Mayor Doug McCallum claims that SkyTrain can fit into that, despite @TransLink cost estimates.
@BlackPressMedia"
"Would this work for Metro Vancouver ? Thoughts? If it cost more to drive and transit was free, would you take it? 
@TransLink @BCTransitCEO #surreybc #newwest #tricities #vancouver #transit"
@CstJPonsioen @TransitPolice @TransLink Elf’n cops.
"These are the plans as they currently stand. @TransLink believes they can complete part of the Fraser Highway line – likely only as far as Fleetwood, but certainly not to #LangleyBC – by 2025, using only the approved $1.65B.
@BlackPressMedia 
"
"I agree, there should be more water transit in the Lower Mainland!"
"Outline of #SkyTrain work plan for ?@CityofSurrey?, 11 steps in all ?over next 15 months.  @TransLink? ?staff says it’s ‘doable’  ?@daka_x? @Cloverdale_BC? ?@SBofT? ?@SurreyMayor? "
"Here are all the things that have to be done in the next 15 months to make SkyTrain along Fraser Hwy a reality.
""It's doable, it's achievable, it's realistic"" as long as everyone works together + cooperates, @TransLink staff tell @mayors_council.
@BlackPressMedia "
"@TransLink Wondering what's happening with the express 95 bus. this past couple of weeks it seems at least 2 runs are cancelled daily due to ""mechanical issue"". Is this happening with other routes? this is such a busy run, a lot of people must be missing meetings and classes."
"@alt130 @TransLink @ShawInfo Okay, wow. So even with prodding to wake up, people still can't manage to be ready to get off the bus/SkyTrain. So they're just being purposely rude then. Yikes!"
@SurreyNowLeader @katslepian @TransLink @mayors_council @BlackPressMedia Not nearly enough women at that table.
#SurreyBC
"This is the updated estimate re: how much of the Surrey-Newton-Guildford LRT funding has been used.
@TransLink's Geoff Cross says extra $$ was freed up b/c Guildford exchange updates did not come out of $1.65B LRT fund.
@BlackPressMedia "
"The earlier estimate for how much @Translink had spent on the Surrey LRT was as high as $77m -- looks like that's dropped to $56m, leaving about $1.6 billion left for the Surrey Skytrain."
@alt130 @TransLink @ShawInfo 
@JanetBrown980 @CityofSurrey @TransLink @daka_x @SBofT @SurreyMayor There needs to be a station at 176 and Fraser hwy to connect transit users to the south of #CloverdaleBC . Many travel to downtown Cloverdale or to north Cloverdale/Clayton heights and may want to go to Langley or Vancouver. The city is missing a crucial connection point.
"@JanetBrown980 @TransLink @CKNW @GlobalBC The province has actually looked into a potential WCE extension from Mission to Abbotsford in the past. This could help decongest Hwy 1, permitting better reliability on rapid buses between Abbotsford and the new SkyTrain terminus in Langley. Study here:  "
@TransLink SkyTrain car 045 door fd2 not opening
When you hear that in order to prepare for skytrain to langley @TransLink would need to cancel the 2019 B-Line plan to Langely! #SurreyBC 
@TransLink any information about flood between Scott road and 22nd street skytrain?  Thank you
@DustinDunsmuir @TransLink Bring a table ?
"Not sure how enthusiastic CP and CN would be over giving up partial access to the Mission Railway Bridge... 

But there is still the old interurban line that ran though Surrey to the valley (now owned by SRY I believe)"
@katslepian @mayors_council @TransLink @BlackPressMedia Should also have weekend Westcoast Express service up the Valley so folks can do weekend trips without a car.
Fantastic news! SkyTrain for the win!
"@kennedystewart @TransLink @UBC @ubcprez Any more buses through the tunnel to cut congestion?
(Every full bus gets 60 cars off the road, morning and nite)"
"@katslepian @TransLink @BlackPressMedia Why are you comparing the full Skytrain expansion to half of the LRT expansion? The real comparison here is $2.9B for skytrain, $3.6B for LRT ($1.65B for LRT phase 1, $1.95B for LRT phase 2). Skytrain fits inside the $3.5B south fraser envelope, LRT does not"
@TransLink @LisachristCBC I liked gloria's comment about the submarine... Was the rain that heavy -- why is it this  never happened other years?  Or did it?
@Pascal1Rodier @TransitPolice @TransLink ? ... I don’t get it. ?
@TransLink To confirm -- are these track issues due to a landslide?
"@TransLink @BCGovNews Cheers, thanks."
A lot of concern being expressed at @TransLink mayors’ council meeting about moving to #SkyTrain technology in ?@CityofSurrey? and cost  to Langley.  ?@SurreyMayor? says 80 per cent of #Surrey residents want SkyTrain. ?@CKNW? ?@GlobalBC? 
@JanetBrown980 @TransLink @CityofSurrey @SurreyMayor @CKNW @GlobalBC That is absolutely false.  So many people want LRT but we have a Mayor who is stuck in the 90's and still sees the City of Surrey as a bedroom community for Vancouver not a thriving City that will compete with Vancouver.
When Translink is running fine but nature still wants the passengers to be mad at @TransLink for something #LifeinVancouver
Awesome!  Good photo @JanetBrown980 !
"#SurreyBC Mayor Doug McCallum has moved this motion at @mayors_council, based on recommendations for @TransLink staff.
@BlackPressMedia "
@TransLink Mayor of Sry. Will stop the fastest growing to nothing if he doesn't wake up
"Now, District of North Van Mayor Mike Little is amending.
He wants @TransLink staff to figure out a diff way to make up $1B funding difference b/w LRT + SkyTrain.
Little also wants staff to come back to the mayors before they start any planning work.
@BlackPressMedia"
@JanetBrown980 @GlobalBC @TransLink @CityofSurrey @SurreyMayor @CKNW Where’s the proof of that?!
Richmond mayor Malcolm Brodie suggesting sending Surrey SkyTrain work plan back to ?@TransLink? staff for complete business plan ?@CityofSurrey? ?@SurreyMayor? ?@CKNW? ?@GlobalBC? 
"""I am completely against this one,"" #SurreyBC mayor Doug McCallum.
Says that making Surrey pay back $56M from LRT is a slippery slope.
""What if you want to change a bus route"" from what @TransLink proposes, he asks, and @mayors_council makes you pay for it?
@BlackPressMedia"
@TransLink how can people get to holdom station the buses are not going down Douglas road
Things getting interesting at ?@TransLink? mayors’ council meeting:   Richmond mayor Brodie calling on @CityofSurrey? to repay 56 M already spent on LRT ?@CKNW? ?@GlobalBC? ??@SurreyMayor? McCallum clearly unhappy. 
@JanetBrown980 @mike__bola @TransLink @CityofSurrey @SurreyMayor @CKNW @GlobalBC nope not 80 percent!

@JanetBrown980 @TransLink @CKNW @GlobalBC @SurreyMayor @CityofSurrey @daka_x @PhilipAguirre5 @Cloverdale_BC @Newton_BIA What a waste of funding. 
"Super disappointed with @TransLink and how they thought splitting the 410 in half would help wait times. I get to my bus stop 5+ minutes early everyday and twice this week had to wait 20+ because the 406 didn't show, resulting with me missing my transfer to get to work on time."
@NEWS1130Traffic @TransLink Thanks!
@JanetBrown980 @TransLink @CKNW @GlobalBC @SurreyMayor @CityofSurrey @daka_x @PhilipAguirre5 @Cloverdale_BC @Newton_BIA Typically rapid transit is built along a city’s most urban corridors - as LRT would have been 
@TransLink LRT do we still live in the Stone Age? What the lower mainland needs is a high-speed bullet train all the way from Van to Hope.

@TransLink there is spilled coffee on car 336
Don't leave your bike there over night @TransLink said though. This is a indoor locker that isn't a good place to leave it. 
@TransLink Actually you guys made me worry when I used it and called. The lady on the phone explained that they are removed if left to long. That doesn't sound good
@TransLink is adorable and has live holiday music at waterfront this morning. Very talented musicians. It really brightened my morning!
@TransLink I throughly I heard on the news that there’s a “shuttle”; not the case? Confirming that it’s same setup as yesterday? Thanks.
@TransLink what’s up with the escalator not being in service for over a month at King George? Elevator was out of service today too... how am I supposed to get my rascal scooter onto the train?
"Serious question @TransLink , what’s wrong with the 22 service?? 2 buses in less than 5 minutes both empties!!!! Ridiculous"
"I would love to drive for @translink. Absolutely zero accountability, how cool would that be?"

@TransLink I’m asking cause I think it is kind of stupid having 3 buses in less than 10 minutes all of them empties
@TransLink And now only 1 430 totally full and busy... I’m not a transit expert but this makes no sense
"@TransLink there is a man in the first cart on the train at burrard heading to waterfront now, he has just been sleeping there from Surrey. I believe he needs some assistance. Thank you !"
"That could change if the Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation asked @TransLink to adopt a “poverty reduction equity mandate”, @PovReductionBC @VivecaEllis #poverty #bc #vanpoli"
@TransLink I get that now the question is wether the demand is equal for those buses services
"@rwittstock @lucio_picciano @TransLink Yellow = prepare to stop if safe to do so.  Split second decision, rather the driver carry on through a yellow than doing a hard brake, potentially hurting dozens on the bus if they fall over. Buses need a lot longer to stop safely than a Mazda."

@TransLink If you guys say so
@RawDeal69 @gpsmendoza @cbcnewsbc @BurnabyRCMP @TransitPolice @TransLink I am saying when the bus driver did not Know how to yield pedestrian ( failed ) then law enforcement officers issue the ticket ! you misunderstand article ! jaywalkers will receive the punishment too when law enforcement officers catch them!
@TransLink I hope is Clear soon @TransLink  #SkyTrain #Millenniumline
@TransLink this is in regards to the fatal accident last night. Wouldn’t that bus have a camera in the front?
@TransLink apparently there’s supposed to be strong winds in a few hours...and I’m thinking that it’ll occur at the time when I have to take the Skytrain. I just hope the wind doesn’t affect it.
"@Trump1234567891 @gpsmendoza @cbcnewsbc @BurnabyRCMP @TransitPolice @TransLink But how do you know the bus driver did not yield? Rcmp have not released any details.

@TransLink any way of getting to stadium from waterfront ?

@TransLink Is there a shuttle service? I’m trying to get to work by burrard right now
@TransLink What happened??
@TransLink Are there any buses that go to Granville Station area from Main Street Science World Station?

@TransLink where is the 403 at 61323??
@TransLink Sorry that's what I meant
@TransLink @mr5ingh FIRE?!  Is this slowing down the Expo Line?  I need to get to Richmond…

Service is expected to resume soon. @NEWS1130"

"@TransLink @mr5ingh its fine, I’ll go to Stadium then walk over"
@TransLink any idea where the 1:40 Pu 555 bus from Lougheed is?
JUST IN: @VanFireRescue says a fire under the tracks near Canada Place is out. It was causing smoke in the tunnel. @TransLink says Expo trains going into downtown are only going as far as Stadium-Chinatown before heading back. #transit
@TransLink is WCE going to be impacted due to the shutdown at Waterfront Station? Any idea yet?
"@carlareesee @TransLink If you don't have mobility issues, I'd just walk.  Should take about 15 minutes: "
Alright.
@AmandaWawryk @TransLink @NEWS1130 @NEWS1130Traffic What caused the fire
@TransLink is the Canada line still going downtown? Bc I need to figure out how to get to work
"@TransLink next time you shutdown entry at Chinatown by Costco post someone so people know what's going on. No notifications, no staff and no entry... Not cool."
@kou__ka @TransLink The 19 going northbound from Main and Terminal has a stop at Pender and Granville that puts you at a few minute walk from the station.
Hopefully it clears up before the commute home.
@silverselene03 @TransLink Thank You so much:)
@GSVStandback @TransLink @mr5ingh Take the 410 from 22nd to Richmond
@TransLink now trains are going as far as Waterfront?
@kou__ka @TransLink No problem! It's the route I always take if something is wrong with the skytrain. Looks like the stations might open back up soon though so double check before you head out.
"@TransLink @CityofVancouver Sorry, we left our mix tape in the tunnel under Waterfront Station....

"I really want to thank @TransLink for the way they handled the fire today, the car I was in was quickly filling with smoke and some were panicking, but there was an attendant on the scene quickly and we were out of the affected area in a safe &amp; timely manner"
@TransLink driver of bus #2186 westbound broadway stopped at willow. Person behind me asked directions to Metrotown. I turned around to tell her. Bus driver closed the door in my face. I knocked on the window to ask if I can get on. He gave me a scowl and drove away.
@TransLink .. seems like we are starting to see a consistent pattern of the 159 getting cancelled from braid during peak hours.
@notthatkhalid @TransLink Glad you’re okay!!?!
@TransLink You folks ever send someone to Europe to see how their trains run on time or no?! Cheers
"@TransLink Wants more money, and can’t even run an efficient service. Bus is 10 mins late....AT the station. Pretty sad."
@TransLink please turn temperature on skytrain down. So warm.
@TransLink can you send someone to check the incoming train area of Granville. Heading to waterfront. Someone had someone else in a corner. Hard to see what’s going on might be nothing
@TransLink what time will the 393 at surrey central be coming?
@TransLink just watched your staff tell an elderly guy with a cane he had to walk all the way back around to the other entrance at Columbia station because someone was working on the gate. Really empathetic.

"@TransLink Bay 8 at Surrey Central Station, for the 326 Guildford. Was supposed to be here at 4:28"
@Translink no 16:48 pickup at 59912 again?!
@TransLink FINALLY arrived.
@TransLink What is the status on the flooded skytrain tracks/stations? Are those parts back up and running?
"@TransLink the new busses along the 22 route are painful for anyone 5'6"" and up. The seats are cramped, the card tap is at child height, and there are less seats/standing room. Maybe rethink the design before making these the new busses for Vancouver?"
@TransLink Yes but it was hard to see and I just noticed out of the corner of my eye as I was getting on the train. Probably long gone by now
This was pretty good @TransLink 
Gonna miss this one.
@TransLink @ihmi @TransLink and the aisles are very narrow; it's like you're punishing us for shopping.
Ok @TransLink plz send @SoundTransit the catalog for your escalator provider.
@TransLink I get on the earlier train to make sure I get to where I need to be at a certain time and yet I’m still fucking late.
@TransLink 228 ?
At Sapperton SkyTrain and just had a CP Rail train pass with 4 horns within 30sec with last one FOR TEN FULL SECONDS right as it was under station! My baby was terrified. This happens EVERY OTHER TIME I'm at this station. @TransLink can we make this better?! #NewWest
@secretasianman @TransLink @ShalayaKipp it does exist!
@TransLink Hi there. Been waiting 10 mins for the #10 at stop 50757. Do you have an update on the ETA? Thank you
"@TransLink Looks like it was canceled, and it just went by NIS. This happens on this route a lot."
"@swkasica @TransLink @ShalayaKipp Pretty magical. Sad though, how the other busses would make fun of it, excluding it from all the bus games"
@TransLink So no 16:48 and the 17:08 is (at least going to be) 10 minutes late. But a bus goes by NIS at 17:05.
@TransLink it smells like electrical smoke in the Burrard train station but I don't see any
"@TransLink Yes, I got on it three mins ago. Thank you for checking and for the reply!"
@TransLink ??? why 
@TransLink yet again the 354 bus from Bridgeport is late however I see buses going to other places that have had 2 or 3 buses leave the station already. This is why I take transit less and have chosen to drive my vehicle instead most days. #inefficient #notachoice #unreliable
@TransLink crash at Nanaimo and Hastings effecting the number 7 had to switch buses to 16. #translink #yvr
@TransLink to be clear the 5:05 bus never showed up. Instead of waiting 10 minutes I waited 25 minutes. This is unacceptable.
@TransLink Is the WCE leaving waterfront at 5:30 today going to be delayed getting into Coquitlam?
@TransLink @whomstdvest PCTC isn’t having a goodtime
@TransLink Can you tell me how late getting into coquitlam station? Im trying to figure out if I will miss my connection
@TransLink is the 153 going up mariner way cancelled?   Was supposed to leave at 5:27. Website only says the 442 was cancelled.
hey @TransLink there’s a pigeon/bird at the top of the up escalator of the inbound platform at marine drive that’s been chilling there all day… can you see if it’s ok?
@TransLink Thank you for the response. I have logged the incident through the link provided.
@TransLink We're just at pomo now on train 3. Normally I'm at Harris Rd/Pitt Meadows by now
@TransLink 17:08 640 bus never showed up at Scott Road station and it looks like the 17:38 bus hasn’t arrived either. Any deets on what’s going on?
Dear @TransLink thanks for the festive jazz performances at Waterfront Station during today's morning and afternoon rush hours.  Very enjoyable. ?
@TransLink not sure if possible but would be nice to be alerted beforehand
@TransLink at Langley center. 531 schedule for 4:46 hasnt shown up. Has it been involved in an alien abduction or something?
@TransLink How about some of those for GVRD? 
"@TransLink since the 151 has cancelled already a few times this evening, when will it start running again from burquitlam"
"@secretasianman @swkasica @TransLink Yeah, but that bus is going to save the day and go down in history!"
@TransLink Yes I ment 5:46
@SurreyRCMP @LMDRCMP @TransLink @nvanrcmp @rcmpgrcpolice I saw this hate speech on the expo line this evening from 5:30pm-6:15pm. It made me highly uncomfortable to sit and stare at it for 45 minutes. Please do something about this. 
@TransLink @SurreyRCMP @LMDRCMP @nvanrcmp @rcmpgrcpolice No I don’t know what the train number was. All I know is that it was on the expo line between 5:30-6:45. I got on at Waterfront and left the train at the King George platform.
@TransLink do buses in Maple Ridge know that the WCE is running late? Or do I have to walk home?
@TransLink 741 from Port Haney
@TransLink is the 394 still coming? It was meant to come at 6:27. It never came. Departing from King George

"@TransLink @TransitPolice I am asking because a couple weeks ago, this happened to me, and nothing was done to the man that put his hands on me, except my info was taken from the driver and I ended up walking to my destination instead of sharing a bus with the man."

@TransLink 54428. A 242 showed up at 10 after so maybe there were. But it’s just so frustrating the inconsistency with this bus route. I need to get to my stop at least 5 minutes early because sometimes it shows up that early or that late. Or not at all. Thanks.

"@TransLink Dear Translink,
I’ve dealt with TTC, I’ve dealt with JP Rail and I’ve dealt with MTR in HK. By far you guys are the worst. To point me to a obscure hard to find section of fine print of how you deal with fraudulent transactions on lost Compass cards is a joke."
@TransLink You guys are the laughing stock of Canadian public transportation. How often are Skytrain delayed?  How many cars do you guys have?  How do you deal with customer complaints like mine?  You guys are in the infancy of the 21st century and are just as worse as ICBC.

"@TransLink This morning at Port Haney WCE station there were signs up that stated River Road would be closed from 6-9pm due to the CP holiday train coming through tonight.  Does that mean that the connecting shuttles won’t be able to pick up passengers from trains 4&amp;5?  (733,741,746 etc)"
"@TransLink @rememberIOU The 159 would appear to operate from PCTC, they sure seem to have a problem covering the Monday morning sheet?"
@TransLink How come the seasonal #ServiceChanges  don’t line up with public school closures ?
@TransLink where’s 602 leaving stop 57361 at 6:24?
@TransLink is the WCE still going slow through second narrows today?
@TransLink when will the Elevators at KG westbound be working?
@TransLink when will the escalators at KG westbound be in service again? Been over a month
@TransLink west side of Coquitlam Central WCE platform has debris from a tree strewn about. Looks like a tree in the ravine was knocked over and is partially overhanging the platform. 
@TransLink ????
@TransLink no 155 to braid station??
@TransLink Second monday in a row it’s been cancelled ???????
@TransLink I beg you please turn off the heat on the 95B line buses. Even your own police have begged the drivers to turn it down.
@TransLink swapping large according buses for little ones at horseshoe Bay and not increasing frequency? Lots of people stuck outside / late for work
"@TransLink if you could please issue a warning to the bus driver that cut us off by turning when our light was still green, causing us to slam on our breaks to avoid going into the bus and having to serve into the other lane. 7:15 bus turned onto duchess st off of Kingsway."
@TransLink Any WCE delays expected this morning due to last wls track washout bw Port Moody amd Waterfront?
@TransLink I got ticketed a while back for paying for parking at the wrong station. I tried to appeal it and was basically told to bigger off. Seems pretty unfair that I paid for parking and made a mistake and still got tagged for the ticket.
@TransLink the #134 never showed up. Now scrambling to not be late for work. Had to walk to Holdom &amp; Parker.  This is the 3rd time in a row this has occurred. What gives? #FrustratedTransitRider 
"Seriously @TransLink , what gives? This bus is already 3min late "
Hey @TransLink where is the 480 at stop #50819 ? Been waiting since 7:21 for this 7:25 and I've never seen it every time I've been waiting for it.
@TransLink Nothing there about the 257. At least a warning would have been nice?

@TransLink Consider them reported now. We’re going at a restricted speed and will be late.
"@TransLink Yes, because it still doesn’t ignore the fact that I am late for work."
@TransLink Why is the schedule at the stop giving me 7:25 and 7:33am? Would be nice to see updated times if this is a consistent thing.
"@TransLink The times listed 7:14, 7:25, 7:33"
@TransLink I’ve been living in the area for about 2wks and the bus has not been anywhere near consistent. It woul be helpful that the website be regularly updated. It makes planning rather helpful. I now have to explain to my employer why I am late.
@TransLink tell 28 to detour through McGill.  Stuck on Cassiar again
@TransLink just wondering if the 412 is a new bus route. Saw one leaving from Bridgeport awhile ago.
"Wow, @TransLink you guys are horrible."
@TransLink How many days will the west coast express trains be delayed by the slide between waterfront and Port Moody?
@TransLink Usually the 95 Burrard arrives early at Duthie and doesn't wait for passengers that have to cross two streets to transfer from the 144 SFU. Today I was pleasantly surprised that the 95 waited for us. Thanks for the speed boost! ?
@TransLink bus 354 late this morning. Stop 58783 ... been waiting 20 minutes

@TransLink why did the 143 leave Burquitlam 6 minutes early? I reached stop 53122 at 8:14 and he drove away as we were approaching
@TransLink I stood for 10 min waiting for departure at 7:55/7:56? It left at 8:07. Vehicle number B9637

"@TransLink The schedule changed for the holidays. The bus, last week left at 8:10 and 8:20. It would have been nice if there was more alerts about the change in schedule."
Hey @translink why is bus #2117 29th ave station not leaving on time? #lateforwork
@TransLink the 99 is NEVER on time at thisstop 58023. Fix it please.
@translink why is the 96bline so unreliable? Waited for more than 15 minutes just for one to arrive. I was there on time as per your schedule but one did not arrive.
"@TransLink Same excuse I get every time I complain... ""Oh that bus isn't late... It's just the bus that was supposed to leave seems not to have showed up ..."""

@TransLink Good Morning @TransLink!  I have a #TransitAlert and #RiderAlert!  You guys are a bunch corporate cronies!  Your loss protection policies protect yourselves and not the rider. You guys should be #ashamed. Hope you get a lump of coal or worse for Christmas.
@TransLink There is no issue. Your bus arrived late (or even skipped) at the 144 and 104 stop. That’s the issue. There should have been a bus that passed by at 823am (as per your schedule) but the bus arrive at 830.

@TransLink What’s the purpose of publishing the schedules if drivers cannot even follow them? And funny how that there were two 337 buses that pass by when the frequency of those buses is way less than that of the 96bline.
@TransLink what's wrong with the 84 this morning?
@TransLink is the elevator at Burrard station in service?
@TransLink is there a reason bus drivers sit and wait for no reason with a bus load of people who need to get to there destination in a timely manner?

Hi @TransLink - can we get drivers immediately behind another bus to continue to the actual stop and not pull out into the left lane before they get there? I've lost count of the number of times this has happened at 99 stops. Thanks!
@TransLink Yes. I also watch this bus close the door on passengers face every single day. Even your 16 and 10 allows people to load from both doors so this mixed messaging is frustrating when every second bus just skips stops when they see fit.
@TransLink what’s going on wth the 43. At Joyce station today and yesterday we have huge lines and the bus doesn’t come.

@TransLink can you play that announcement again in the actual sky trains? We can't hear that when our train is parked out of the station
Did the 7:35 159 coquitlam stn leaving Braid get canceled again this morning? @TransLink i don’t see it on the radar..
"@TransLink Ohhhh ok i see, Thanks! I see the two busses close together there now on the GPS. are you able to tell me which of those (bus#) will be taking the detour to take the kids to school? I want to make sure I don’t get on that one"
@TransLink They’re not showing up.
@TransLink Thanks!
@TransLink Are there delays on 602 NB? Still waiting at stop no. 57370...
@TransLink Trash tier service.
"@TransLink I understand, but they aren’t coming in the over 25 min I’ve waited the last two days"
"@TransLink was there a delay with the 33? A bunch of us were waiting 20 minutes for one to arrive at 29th Ave Station, when it usually comes every 10 minutes."
@TransLink #340 Late again
@TransLink 2 months + is unacceptable. What’s the ETA and how can this be followed up for a firm commitment from Translink? It’s so dangerous.
@TransLink Multi bus waits for 84 bus Eastbound. There may be fewer people going to UBC this week but people still need to work. :(
Fuck you @TransLink . That is all
@TransLink Is something wrong with the 340 bus? Have been waiting for 30 mins and both buses never showed up. This bus has become so unreliable.
"Hi 340 to 22nd, I'm at Wade Rd stop, are you doing ok?? It's been There's a lot of people here worried about u @TransLink"
"@TransLink Our bus driver Literally just hopped off our bus, not saying a word, left the bus running, Full of early morning commuters TO GET A COFFEE AT TIMS!!!! Bus #2216 "
@TransLink How often are the Skytrains cleaned? These last few mornings I’ve gotten on trains that were filthy with garbage and grime. Must be attracting lots of pests because I have the bug bites to prove it.
@TransLink Waiting for 340 at 120 st&amp; 64 ave from last 50 minutes.  When the next bus is coming?
@TransLink At 120st and 70Ave.
@TransLink Thank you!!

@TransLink why is this bus route always missed in Translinks posts...
@TransLink is the next one comjbg
@TransLink is the next one coming
"I just learned @TransLink allows folding bikes but not folding e-scooters onboard. They're the same size, I'm not sure I understand the logic of the policy. There goes my last mile plans for both ends of my future commute. The alternative...driving more. Yay adding to congestion."
Hey @TransLink have you decreased the frequency of trains or is ridership up? Sure seems a lot more dense at all hours of the day...
it’s way too hot on this bus @TransLink its roasting in here in the summer because u hav awful AC and now i’m roasting again in the winter. pls fix this.
@TransLink Do trains still run to King George from Waterfront? Just saw one to Edmonds and next one was to Prod Way.
@TransLink Got it. Thanks! Guess I’ll just have to transfer at Edmonds then?
Love you too!
@TransLink nobody else was stripping off their layers so i’m guessing i was the only one dying
@TransLink Thanks!
#ReindeerBus spotted again .. have YOU seen it around town?
@FEEZYDoesIT @TunaPhish09 @TransLink Not obvious. Actually wrong. Your dismissal of everything but the private car as an option for mobility is getting tiresome.
@winkybiker @TunaPhish09 @TransLink I'm actually for a B-Line not necessarily for a dedicated full time lane.
@winkybiker @TunaPhish09 @TransLink And welcome to democracy where people have varying opinions. I am happy to have you here as part of a discussion as always ?
".@TransLink will help Metro Vancouver residents start 2019 safely, offering free transit and extended services on New Year's Eve. See route and schedule details here:  #yvrnye #bctransit "

"@TransLink Thanks, the driver had initially disappeared but my apprehension proved unfounded!!"
"@daithimckay Hi Daithí, thanks for your comments. If you feel that this is something that should be implemented you can email your suggestions into feedback@translink.co.uk and it will be passed on to the relevant department. ^CS"
@TransLink Yes. Continuously.
Will use the new B-Line buses when they are up and running? #Coquitlam #PortCoquitlam #PortMoody #MapleRidge @TransLink
@NVanDistrict @TransLink A couple of questions: 1. Could you clarify “...the existing dedicated bus lane will be extended several blocks to Philip Ave.”? So dedicated lane only from Philip to LGB? 2. Re: Additional space gained - will you be removing bike lanes anywhere along Marine? 
.@TransLink one week to Christmas. Are you excited as I am?
@TransLink Canada line train has been stopped for several min at Broadway - any idea what is going on?
@TransLink Is Canada line malfunctioning again? My train from Richmond says terminus is king edward instead of waterfront
@TransLink Medical. Still slow but moving again
@TransLink Canada Line  currently only going up to King Edward? Can't find info on your website about it
So thankful to the very generous public  of Northern Ireland
@TransLink Thank you.
I swear everytime I go to Burrard Station at least one of the escalators is broken/not moving @TransLink
@TransLink #coastmountainbuscompany are firing an employee that had some #Mentalhealth issues due to medication interactions that was ENTIRELY out of her control. AT CHRISTMAS! People can NOT be fired because of this. When did #Scrooge become #CEO of #translink @humanrights1st
@TransLink Yupp. The escalators on the side by the stairs (leaving the station going up) is not running

"@GlenBikes @TransLink @soundrider Folding things under a single brand is a good idea, but having operations under a single mega-agency is a very, very bad idea. Lots of boderline service would be lost to patch holes in other areas, and everyone loses."
@TransLink #20 bus being blocked on Robson at Granville by someone yelling at driver. Security?
@TransLink 
@TransLink It's alarming how dirty those few train can get when not regularly cleaned overnight. It's unpleasant to ride in trash-ridden cars in the morning. I hope pest control inspections are also part of maintenance because passengers getting bitten by bugs is also an inconvenience.
All public transit will be free on New Year's Eve thanks to @TransLink! 
@communicatto @Bell_LetsTalk @CBCOlympics @KellyVSki @Craig_McMorris @vicecanada @TimHortons @Mackinnon9 @TransLink @stephanie_ip @Sethrogen Thanks for the shout out @communicatto! We’re sure did have fun with our campaign ?
@SounderBruce @TransLink @soundrider Is TransLink resulting in borderline service being lost? I haven't followed them very closely since I left Vancouver ~17 yrs ago. I haven't heard this critique reported though.
"@TransLink @dandelionangora Well yay: so reading the alerts now there is no elevator access at Surrey Central, King George, and Gateway Stations. 


That’s… great."
"@TransLink Actually, turns out Surrey Central’s elevator IS working. Might want to update your website status."
"@TransLink when a bus comes infrequently like the 44 does, having a missing bus or an early one means people miss appointments. Regretting not driving downtown instead today. :("

@TransLink Thank you so much :)
"@cstefan206 @GlenBikes @SounderBruce @TransLink @soundrider I don’t mind all the agencies operating the buses, but it would be great if they shared the service names like “Rapid Ride” (née Express) or Swift (née BRT) or InterCity” that way one knows what to expect service-wise"

@TransLink :( i could have taken a different bus
@TransLink can you please send me the form to give feedback. I had issues with this bus this morning too ??

@TransLink 53804 188 never came at 6:36. Wasted time
@TransLink is there a way to see reported issues 10 mind prior?
@TransLink actually the next bus was 5 mind early. 188 has mechanical issues every day at least once. It's a disgrace of a bus. Ugh

@TransLink what happened to the 828 at 55800?
@TransLink what happened to notifying Customers of schedule change. 103 was running late last night ...but asked why late this morning to be informed schedule change for Holidays.  No signs....
@TransLink I know this. But it was still saying insufficient fare well after 8 hours of loading.
"My birthday wish is that the 320 bus actually came on schedule so I could get to work on time. Or world peace, whichever one isn't just a dream @TransLink"
"@TransLink It was loaded at 7:45 am, and still saying insufficient fare at 5:45 pm."
@TransLink We were at the first stop after it leaves Renisannce Square heading back to Skytrain.  Driver told us schedule change. Apparently been running like this for at least the last two days...bus leaves 7:58 then 8:05ish and that bus should be the 8am one....and other should be 7:50.
"@TransLink Hey, could you check 188 at 53792? Thanks."

"@AMacNewWest @cahilldrummer @stickers66 @FRFuggitivi @New_Westminster @TranBC @TransLink @WeAreHub And as I mentioned earlier, the jerks at SRY Rail put up that section of fence to restrict access to the safer route (gravel trail) that was running parallel to the sidewalk, but set back 10-15ft from the road.

@JustinNTurcotte @PhilRidinBikes @AMacNewWest @cahilldrummer @stickers66 @FRFuggitivi @New_Westminster @TranBC @TransLink @WeAreHub I mention that stretch every BTWW on the HUB survey. It's a death trap for bikes.
"@AMacNewWest @JustinNTurcotte @PhilRidinBikes @cahilldrummer @stickers66 @FRFuggitivi @New_Westminster @TranBC @TransLink @WeAreHub They could set photo radar on that stretch at 70km/h and they'd issue tickets to 90+% of drivers.

"@PhilRidinBikes @AMacNewWest @JustinNTurcotte @cahilldrummer @stickers66 @FRFuggitivi @New_Westminster @TranBC @TransLink @WeAreHub They should go to one Northbound lane, re-align and put separated bike lanes on each side. The NB lanes are only fed by one lane at a time anyway."
@DeanReimer @PhilRidinBikes @AMacNewWest @cahilldrummer @stickers66 @FRFuggitivi @New_Westminster @TranBC @TransLink @WeAreHub Biggest issue they'd have to deal with is the absolute quagmire between Lougheed and the Trans-Canada underpass. That section of parking lot entrances is so poorly designed.
"@JustinNTurcotte @DeanReimer @AMacNewWest @cahilldrummer @stickers66 @FRFuggitivi @New_Westminster @TranBC @TransLink @WeAreHub Yeah, but that whole area is about to be torn up and redone for the new towers anyway. And the current plan DOES include some bike infra. So the biggest challenge will be Braid to Hwy 1 overpass. The Best Western is already being torn down to make way."
"@JustinNTurcotte @DeanReimer @PhilRidinBikes @cahilldrummer @stickers66 @FRFuggitivi @New_Westminster @TranBC @TransLink @WeAreHub There are major changes coming to that stretch as Delestre will be closed to North, and a new E-W connector almost along Rochester to Lougheed/Alderson will be installed, as part of the redevelopment of the old Best Western site."

"@TransLink at nanaimo station as i tweet.why isn't the escalator working? the gates are open and people are walking up the stairs or the escalator.also i know the escalator isn't under repair.
it's like this everyday.fix the issue
thanks"
"@shirleyclerkin @Buseireann I see you're in Ireland. @translink is  for transit in Vancouver,BC Canada. Here's the one you need: @translink_NI ^RR"
@TransLink Is Translink prepared for the heavy rains? Especially at underground stations like Columbia?

@TransLink are the 620 drivers from Bridgeport Station advising passengers of the ferry Cancellations?
@TransLink are the 620 drivers from Bridgeport advising passengers of ferry cancellations?
@TransLink Customer service yea
@TransLink if the gatw is open someone should turn the escalator 's not that hard.
"@TransLink not a good enough answer
get it fixed"
@TransLink 250 &amp; 257 notifying passenger about Ferries?
@TransLink good morning! Are the wires repaired and the 7 running normally this morning?
Ho Ho Ho!  @TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond taking your year end calls today at 4:30 on @CKNW - got a question you'd like answered?  Tweet me!
"@steeletalk @TransLink @CKNW How about ""straightening out"" the 159 "
@TransLink Re-route skipped everyone on 64th.
@TransLink Is this affecting 14 UBC? Waiting at 50958 for 20 minutes now....
@TransLink Skytrain bound for Waterfront is just sitting on the tracks at Olympic Village. What? You forget to change the batteries?
@TransLink is the Canada line expecting any issues today due to the wind storm?
"@TransLink @vancouveric Hi, am waiting on Renfrew and Broadway for the 16 bus.. northbound.. have been here for 30mins.  Is the bus coming? It's 8:15am now"
@TransLink #coastmountainbus fired a driver because of #mentalhealth issues. This is a blatant violation of @humanrights1st and an unjust act on the company's part. @CTVVancouver @GlobalBC
30min wait for 25 bus going westbound??? @TransLink
@steeletalk @TransLink @CKNW Why does the 27 bus route often just not show up?
@TransLink My 148 Bus to Royal oak driver is on his phone while driving.
@steeletalk @TransLink @CKNW Will Rideshare and Taxi stands be incorporated into the new Broadway line station layouts?
@TransLink It’s not the bus phone looks like a silver flip phone. And S1324
"@TransLink 84 from UBC to VCC-Clark 8:28, 8:32, 8:36 didn’t come"
@TransLink Thank you. We are all off the bus now at the station now.
@TransLink given the wind warns is there a threshold that cancels the seabus ?
"@TransLink no need, managed to squeeze onto a bus, but alot of people aren't so lucky, especially those in Fraser st"
@TransLink @WestVanDistrict  rode the Reindeer bus today- what a fun tradition! 
[Mobility] Congratulations to @TransLink on smashing a new record with 39.6 million boardings recorded in October! ?? #ProudPartner #Vancouver ??  @thalescanada via @rail_pro_mag 
@TransLink what’s with the Canada Line delay? Waterfront bound the train stuck at King Edward
@ReindeerBus You came to Surrey! I haven’t see you yet this year. Hope to see you soon! ??
Fuck you  @TransLink
@DEADLINE Weird that OWN can breakup with Salim but CNN won't fire Chloe Melas for LYING on Morgan Freeman causing HIM to lose @TransLink &amp; @visa jobs WITHOUT an investigation. She STILL has a job. HE lost 2. #firechloemelas  #metoo #bullshit 
Train stopped at King Edward Station and no further announcement @TransLink
@TransLink what up with the Canada Line?
@TransLink any update on the Canada Line? My train seems to be stuck for an abnormal amount of time at King Ed (northbound)
@TransLink why is the Canada line not moving? I been stuck at king Edward for 10 mins now
@TransLink Oncd again the Canadian line doesn’t make any effort to tell its riders what’s going on.
@BowinnMa @JonathanWNV @maryannbooth @LindaCBuchanan @Mike4DNVMayor @TranBC @SquamishNation @tsleilwaututh @TransLink Thanks for this! Is there a set of milestones and progress report online we can view? Would love to see online reporting of milestone achievement.
@TransLink Good to know. Thanks
@TransLink escalator @ Burrard station is still not working
@TransLink Thanks. There are staff here explaining now
@TransLink How should I get downtown? Should I go to the other platform at King Rd? Or is it better to stay waiting on my train?
@TransLink How about some updates on the Production Way Skytrain Line please?
@TransLink Finally moving. Thanks
@TransLink Columbia Station
@steeletalk @TransLink @CKNW 1. When can we get 4 car Mark 2s on the Millennium line? 2. Why are the escalators at Main street station always under maintenance when they are less than 5 years old?
@TransLink Shame ?
"@TransLink We’ve just been told that there’s a bus bridge around Sapperton train breakdown OR go north to Commercial and then catch the Millennium Line to Production Way. 

You’re welcome"
@steeletalk @TransLink @CKNW Tell him thanks for making the decision to own a car such an easy one...
@TransLink Why not run one from production to sepperton and shuttle service to Columbia?
@TransLink How long on the bus bridge?
When inbound @TransLink #canadaline train becomes outbound  without warning = confusing
@TransLink Is that why the train is being held at Royal Oak?
@TransLink why is this train at commercial not moving? I gotta get to work!
@TransLink waiting here at 22nd street. Would appreciate an update
@TransLink Any updates on bus bridge at Columbia?
@TransLink I lost my doctor appointment because of how long the bus bridge is taking to implement. Thanks @TransLink
"@TransLink can you tell me why the westbound expo line is stopping for multiple minutes at every stop.

I've been on the train for like 10 minutes and gone one stop. Zero communication. Your ""customer service"" people just gawked at us and said nothing. People have places to be."
@TransLink Train parked on east bound tracks door closed at braid 
@TransLink we're being packed like sardines in here with no information.
@TransLink Your employees told us nothing of a bus bridge so now I’m on the long way to Lougheed on the 157. Thanks translink!

"@TransLink Thx 
Just no updates provided"

"@TransLink Announcements re: delays on Expo Line, can’t hear you at Nanaimo station."
@TransLink Good thing I don't need to use that line today
.@patersonjeff has been campaigning for years for @TransLink to drop one of the T's
"@TransLink Right, but the train was stalled more than 30 mins. You couldn’t foresee you’d need buses for a bus bridge until now?"
@TransLink stuck at sapperron stn. Expo line is down
@TransLink Which road is blocked and at what points? Cause? @NEWS1130Traffic
@TransLink Where to catch the bus bridge at Braid going to Columbia? No sky train staff here for me to ask.
@TransLink So I decided to take train to Broadway and take millennium from commercial to lafarge is there delays for that trying to give work an ETA
@TransLink Trains flowing into town ok from Columbia?
@TransLink can't hear announcements regarding delays on the trains only platforms wtf
@TransLink @NEWS1130Traffic Thank you!
@TransLink I was referring into waterfront

"@TransLink heading to lougheed or braid stn, where do I board the bus bridge to connect to Edmonds? Will it be fixed in the next hour?"
@steeletalk @TransLink @CKNW Why don’t buses move when it snows?
"@shawnbristow @TransLink I too start every day with a hearty ""fuck you @translink"""
@TransLink @GlobalBC TransLink Update: Buy a car dumbasses! You live in Vancouver ?
@TransLink can I send you a private message? I am on a train from Edmonds to Downtown. It is not an emergency...
@steeletalk @TransLink @CKNW When will the North Shore get a real solution like SkyTrains instead of unused bike lanes?
@TransLink Does the bus bridge go to all the skytrain stations affected?
"@TransLink Are there delays westbound, King George to Waterfront as well?"
"@TransLink You guys can do better than this. I was at Columbia Station for 
about an hour before bus came. Thank you."
"@TransLink Awesome, thank you!"
@TransLink You guys can do better than this. I was at Columbia Station for about an hour before bus came. Thank you.
@BCBawnee No kidding. @TransLink  ain't helping anyone except Surrey n Langley. Everyone one else gets services cut n a big ??
@TransLink is there any idea when the road block will be fixed?
@TransLink I can’t private message you unless you follow me. There is just a woman on my train I am concerned about.
@TransLink Train 077 just leaving Main Street.
"@TransLink Train 077 coming up to Stadium, a woman in a red parka. She has been passed out since I got on but refuses help. I am worried about her."
@TransLink Is the frequency of the trains being affected?
"@TransLink  this is my Yearly tweet to say even though I’m a bit um cranky with you all on here waiting for Transit ,you are fabulous  thank you for All your hard work this Year ?? "

@TransLink Is it still possible to get from Sappeton to Waterfront?
@TransLink Do you have any idea when train service will be restored from Columbia Station to Lougheed Station?
@TransLink Thanks for the info. I know you are doing your best
@TransLink Thanks!
"Hey @TransLink I""m on a SkyTrain ""special"" M-line busbridge &amp; the driver is asking passengers for directions. This doesn't inspire confidence."
"@TransLink One more thing, which bay from lougheed?"
@TransLink thank you for getting the escalator &amp; elevator working at King George Skytrain Station ?
@TransLink Which tracks are having issues in the Columbia-Lougheed section?
@TransLink Great! There are a lot of people complaining on this bus btw...sorry you guys have to deal with all this lol
"Our 103 bus driver (S1305, I think was the vehicle number) this morning gave all the kids on her route a little bag of Christmas gifts. It was such a lovely gesture. Definitely above &amp; beyond. Give her a raise, @TransLink!"
@TransLink @ItsTylerG_ @_EPettersson @Canucks I just made a formal request. Our lord and saviour Elias Pettersson deserves this...
Interesting article by @DanielBettridge in @DailyHiveVan this morning about how Vancouverites say thank you to #transit operators! I did a small research study on this a few years ago myself for @UBCSauderSchool:  @TransLink
@TransLink Shit happens haha ! Don’t let the angry folks get to ya. Thanks again ?
@TransLink - was the 103 Victoria Hill that was supposed to depart at 11:00 canceled?

Such a nice surprise! Like always @TransLink @JustinTrudeau

"Windy day, love it. (@ Metrotown SkyTrain Station - @translink in Burnaby, BC) "
@RobTheHockeyGuy @patersonjeff @TransLink Man am I ever ready for vacation. Just spent 5 seconds trying to figure out why JPat would want it to be called Ranslink...
"@TransLink ok, what's up?

When I got to Columbia, how do I get to Metrotown?
Which bus am I looking for? 
And since I need to stop at Columbia anyways (and walk to about halfway between Columbia and new West), would it be easier/faster to shuttle from New West?"
@TransLink at Victoria &amp; 41st going towards UBC?
Dear @TransLink I appreciate the ? 
@TransLink What's the best way to get to Production Way from Surrey?
"@pwatkins63 @nigelmalkin1 @TheClosures @CraigCameronWV @maryannbooth @CraigCameronWV, @maryannbooth, @TransLink - one more thing: will DWV/TransLink be collecting before/after data on traffic volumes/efficiency, transit ridership, merchant sales, pedestrian/cycling safety, etc?"
@TransLink where is the 341 to guilford from newton. The 11:46 hasn't shown up.
@RobTheHockeyGuy @patersonjeff @TransLink Only if Pettersson himself does the announcement.

@TransLink Is the train running normally between Columbia and waterfront?
"@TransLink Yeah, my bad, for some reason I was thinking the""common corridor"" before the track splits was father down, and was confused why you would stop the trains at Columbia.

Got it sorted, thanks"

@TransLink Yes but I’m west boulevard where the 43 and 41 are there hasn’t been a bus in 30 min +. So a lot of people walked up to the stop above
@banthiav @DailyHiveVan @UBCSauderSchool @TransLink Old article that's been reshared I guess but thanks for the link will read with interest. Can guarantee its far more worthy reading than my own drivel ?

@TransLink How long is the wait for the train from braid to Lougheed
@ItsTylerG_ @TransLink @_EPettersson @Canucks Are you fucking kidding me?? Be hasn't done a thing so far. What're are his 50 goals or 100 points?? No cups either
@TransLink I think some branches have blown onto the train track between renfrew station and broadway stations. The train brushed something along the way.
@TransLink Do check the channel of your radio at Car 218 heading to VCC Clark - Millennium Line. We can hear your private talk among officers.
"Current @TransLink #SkyTrain status:

Just... don't right now ?"
@TransLink tree on the tracks
Y'ALL THIS TRAIN CAME INTO THE STATION SMOKING AND THE POLE IN THE TRAIN HIT SOMEONE IN THE FACE AND THE GLASS BROKE TOO I'M SO SHOOK @TransLink 
@banthiav @DailyHiveVan @UBCSauderSchool @TransLink Well that was absolutely fascinating. Thanks so much for sharing!
"@svanan77 @TransLink I think that was accidentally on all of them, every train could hear them ?"
@TransLink where is the 340 at 55933? It's late... Again
@TransLink What is happening at Surrey Central station now???? No trains are moving
@TransLink Are the SkyTrains running just fine??
@TransLink Theme of today 
@TransLink we cannot understand a word on the expo line. Please try again. #transit
@TransLink any issues with the Westcoast express this afternoon?
@sarasaberi_ @TransLink ?
Y'ALL THIS TRAIN CAME INTO THE STATION SMOKING AND THE GLASS AND POLES BROKE AND SOMEONE WAS BLEEDING I'M SO SHOOK @TransLink 
"Not a good transit day. Sitting on a powered down Skytrain at 29th Ave. This wind. @TransLink, we feel for you."
Hey @TransLink are the 480 buses running late?
Why does @TransLink announcements  sounds so muffled everytime ????
@TransLink 15 minutes late and counting
Also @TransLink y'all can't handle winds ????  Lmfao
@TransLink has something happened on the Surrey branch I have Been waiting what for what seem like 20 mins
"Current @TransLink #SkyTrain status:

Lots of trees and branches blowing into the guideway, getting caught under trains and setting off track alarms. Ongoing service disruption between Braid and Sapperton. Medical emergency ongoing on the Expo Line. Wind warnings in effect."
@TransLink This translink dude at king George is saying it won’t run for at least 2 hours so maybe be honest
@TransLink Sorry ignore my last tweet
@TransLink Let people know what's going on or you're going to lose a lot of respect and customers. 32 years of this and you'd think you'd be better at dealing with weather permitting conditions.
@TransLink This is the delay: branch fell on the track and smashed the windshield 
@TransLink Please update on trains leaving King George
@sarasaberi_ @TransLink how can they control the weather?
Hey @TransLink any reports of @ReindeerBus flying out there today? ???
@lalloalo @TransLink what the hell happened to it gfsfjjffjh !!
@TransLink the wheelchair gate is stuck open on the Richmond side at marine drive skytrain. 
@translink why the fuck is this such a horrible bus system? I texted at 1:10pm &amp; it never showed up. WTF?! I stood here 5 minutes before the actual time. It actually showed up at 1:19pm.… 
Train caught a Christmas tree on the tracks! #SkyTrainDelay #WindStormBC #VancouverSkyTrain @TransLink 
"@shanna_d88 @TransLink the weather isn't what I'm talking about, but they can take measures to help the train work better under the conditions. They know how Vancouver can be. Work with it."
@Lixa123 @TransLink omg i wasnt on the train i just saw it come into the station but it was so windy it blew a tree onto the tracks and our theory is the impact of the train hitting the tree knocked the pole out of place and the pole hit the girl in the head and broke the glass
"@TransLink Yeah it's a bit bigger than a ""branch"""
@sarasaberi_ @TransLink I'd like to see you do better- oh woops your complaining ass is all you're good for :') smh. They've got staff working hard on-site unlike your ungrateful unpatient ass LMAO
"@TransLink It’s not delay, is not running!"
@sarasaberi_ @shanna_d88 @TransLink So how exactly do you want them to stop branches from falling on the track due to the wind? Enclose the whole thing? Most of the trees aren't even on their property so it's not like they can go cut at will.
@sarasaberi_ @TransLink The respect was gone long ago but the people keep going back.
@TransLink @ReindeerBus Lol you didn’t catch the joke. High winds ?but thank you
"@TransLink There is always something with sky train ,, I’m so sick of it ??"
"@TransLink Come on guys, it’s cold and windy. Could you at least give us a time estimate ?"
@TransLink Are there bus bridges being set up? Tons of people are stuck at Scott road / in Surrey with no way back home
@TransLink what happened of phone line?
@TransLink  just a head up. There is a tree down on the Lougheed highway. Between Shaughnessy and Coquitlam. Just a heads up for the 701 bus and the 160. ??
@Translink is train 335 in service?
@TrueBettyCanada @TransLink You know they’re human too
@TransLink Why aren't there updates on the SkyTrain about the debris? Lots of confused people wondering why our train isn't moving.
@TransLink any shuttles running from King George Station? No TransLink personnel here to help.
@TransLink If I was trying to get to Douglas in New West what would be the best route?
"After 20 minutes just hanging out on a Skytrain car, @TransLink announced that the entire Expo line is down and that we should ""make alternate travel arrangements"". No shuttles, no buses, nothing - we're on our own."
"@TransLink so to get to Richmond today from New West, I once again have to either hike to 22nd or take two buses to get there.  This is nuts!  I know we can’t help a storm, but why is there no direct service to 22nd when this happens?"
@TransLink Any busses running from King George Station to DT or Metrotown?
@TransLink Given that it’s weather related it’s going to be fluid   Everyone just chill
@TransLink hi. I'm stuck at king George. Is there a bus service that would take me to burnaby? Need to get to work. Thanks
@moebius_strip @TransLink Sounds like ttc
@TransLink Any idea how much longer?
@moebius_strip @TransLink Was about to get on the Canada Line... guess my odds are better braving the storm on my bike
"@nhotte @moebius_strip @TransLink Canada line seems to not have had any issues today, so might be worth the risk."
"@TransLink Ok phew, cuz it didn’t pick up passengers and zoomed past the station. Just makin sure."
@KenLinVanC @TransLink It's as if people haven't experienced inclement weather before. Heaven forbid!
@TransLink Thanx guys.
@TransLink I saw a train from Patterson running. Are all trains now running? Or is it false hope? @TransLink
"@TransLink I'm starting around poco and Coquitlam, hoping to get there between 4 and 5"
@TransLink Any idea how long?
@translink skytrain update please
@TransLink I take the Braid-Sapperton area is cleared? I'm on a train to Production.
@TransLink Thanks!
@TransLink Train 336 isn’t picking up passengers? It missed Burrard and Granville
@TransLink thanks but I'm on my way to a meeting and I'm already in a cab
@TransLink Is there an ETA In when normal service will be resumed?
@TransLink @killaines Thank you but apps are more convenient than phoning somebody. I've suggested before (online feedback) to improve trip planner.
@TransLink is the production train problem fixed yet? Or still using bus bridge?
@TransLink wondering if Seabus is affected by the windstorm? Thanks!
@TransLink @ReindeerBus ??
@TransLink Is the Evergreen Line affected at all?
@TransLink Is there a bus bridge between Columbia and Lougheed?
@TransLink what’s with the 152 delay? Been waiting at Coquitlam station in this horrible wind waiting for it...
@TransLink No line can not go through
Does anyone know if Canada Line is running into downtown? @TransLink  #BCStorm
@TransLink if we are going to sit for however long on closed up trains can you ask control to turn a/c on car 340 is getting nice and toasty. Need air flow
"@TransLink why is my train going so slowly after leaving Scott Rd, going to Columbia?"
@TransLink Thanks!
Hey @TransLink. Im on the 157 lougheed and we've run into 2 police roadblocks and had to detour and go around. Can you let your other drivers know?
"@TransLink from Nanaimo to 29th ave I think the train went over some branches or they were falling on top of the train, not sure, but it was kinda loud thuds."
Yikes...
@TransLink how bad do the winds have to get before you shut down the Canada line?
@TransLink Thanks got to work on time??
@felishaphillips @TransLink Thank you for asking this question! We really need a bus that goes over the pattulo bridge!
Dear @TransLink thank you restoring expo line service so fast. that being said the phrase “ please arrange an alternate service” implies a delay of much greater length. This may cause some to “arrange an alternate service”
@TransLink where is the 601 Bridgeport? @ SD Exchange. Late because of the wind?
"@martynschmoll @pwatkins63 @nigelmalkin1 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @TransLink Yes to most.  I will try to confirm.  Ridership obviously. Not sure about business sales, for example."
@TransLink bus driver on 250 just shut off the bus and walked off without saying anything. He came back 3 minutes later and after being asked what is going on he said he had to use the restroom. No communication at all. Not very impressed ? I understand there is traffic but cmon
"@moebius_strip @TransLink Usually when rail goes down they can't replace the capacity with buses anyways, simply not enough buses"
"@CraigCameronWV @pwatkins63 @nigelmalkin1 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @TransLink Thx. Given the source of much of the opposition, it seems crucial that DWV look at impacts on business. Important case study for similar projects going forward."
@martynschmoll @pwatkins63 @nigelmalkin1 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @TransLink Agree 100%
@TransLink Thank you for the safety and keeping the trains running in this wind storm. Really appreciate your help and the station attendants too!
@TransLink Is the seabus still running on time in these winds?
"@TransLink I was, thank you muchly"
@TransLink where’s the 103 @ 58744
@TransLink Didn’t know wind affected bus routes too..
@TransLink can i get a train to 22nd?  Are the trains running at all?  It’s so windy!
@TransLink Please tell which is the best way to get from New West to Lougheed Station?
@TransLink is something happening with millenium line westbound vcc clark? Experiencing unusual delay.
@TransLink how is the situation with teh #CanadaLine during this #windstorm  #Vancouver ?
"Hey #BCPOLI good #ProRepWarrior lost.  Now ELMTOTS have dreams of 83 @BowinnMa MLAs.  #ProRep would deny transit fans of a repeat of 2001!

"@lalloalo @averincm @TransLink My coworker was late to work because of this! Is everyone okay, do we know?"

@TransLink Production way. It seems to be back to normal now.
"@TransLink I’m on the evergreen line and the skytrain just slammed on the brakes in the tunnel on the millennium line, what gives?"

@TransLink Is there no 3:54 33 leaving UBC today?
@TransLink Excellent job with the shuttle pickup for the passengers going West on Davie after Burrard. Thank you.
@TransLink is the Canada line affected by delays at all? Can't get a cab due to the train issues &amp; I need to get to the airport
Im ready to die ?
@TransLink just a FYI - burrard station smells like something is burning?
@TransLink Hey everything alright with the 17 Oak? Been waiting for quite a while and wondering if the bus is just stucking in traffic or down
@mai_nightmare @TransLink middle escalator is so useless at this point
"@TransLink Uuhh, smoke at Burrard #skytrain station is a thing now?"
@TransLink why is Granville station smokey? #skytrain
@TransLink we have a bus with no driver for the 23 at stop#59929 that was supposed to leave five mins ago
"@lalloalo @TransLink I initially read glass and poles as glass poles. Was gonna say, that's just a bad idea to begin with. Though hopefully no-one was seriously hurt. This is why trains shouldn't be allowed to smoke!"
@TransLink is the 555 running normally or detoured?

@TransLink @JenJenJensen1 ?
@TransLink With the major wind is there still service to the #55324 or should I go to Langley Exchange? (For the 502 or the 320?)

@TransLink you still have debris on the tracks just west of 29th Avenue because we just ran over it.
@TransLink As long as the trains are still running.  Thx.
@TransLink No 319 Newton Exchange buses have shown up at Scott Road Station for 20 minutes now-you might want to have a Skytrain attendant on site to manage the huge line up.

@TransLink @steeletalk @CKNW The buses on 4th and broadway frequently run red lights; and drive down the middle of the street blocking 2 lanes.
@TransLink is the Canada line running?
"@TransLink just a heads up, Burrard station smells like burning electrical near the far left stairs going down to the lower platform"
@TransLink Thanks
@TransLink @steeletalk @CKNW Great speech!
People REALLY REALLY suck on busses. @TransLink By FAR the worst city I’ve been a disabled transit rider of.
@TransLink In 30 minutes I have seen 3 123 busses heading to New West Station and not a single one heading North. Clearly a sink hole has opened up.
Ah sorry - just saw this!
@TransLink @bchydro Right along the path between the station and the bc hydro building
@TransLink Except the ones now riding the detour from hell lol
@TransLink At Edmunds Skytrain Stn bus loop one of the inner shelter sign boards is loose. Not dangerous as yet but the potential exists. FYI.

@TransLink BC Hydro map shows power outage at Braid Station
@TransLink big backlog of passengers at waterfront. Any reason why?
@TransLink Apple Pay is showing compass transactions as “stavros auto body”?
"@TransLink No visible smoke, smelt better near the middle of the lower platform if that helps locating the source. Sorry you guys have been having such a rough and busy day, hope it gets better! :)"
@TransLink hi your bus at stop 61787 hasn’t showed up in 50 mins. Please advise
@TransLink It seems whenever the weather turns bad you throw in the towel. You don’t find alternatives. Leaving drivers dealing with angry and tired and cold passengers.
@TransLink I gave up and walked home up a very long hill.
@TransLink #14 driver wouldn’t let 2 of us on despite 4 people getting off. Unacceptable.
@TransLink why can’t you fix it so the 174 is here to get people from the train! 20 minutes late so far. Been like this for months.
hey @TransLink are there any delays with the 640? the 5:08 bus hasnt left scott rd station yet
"@TransLink @Austin39140404 I see what you did there, @translink ? "
"@TransLink 3 170s, 2 173s, 175s, 160s, and 188s have gone by well we wait for a single 174. This, sadly is typical."
@JarBainbridge @TransLink Eastbound just west of 29th station.
@TransLink 246 Vancouver I was just on blew a flat tire around the Norcross way stop. Is this gonna affect the schedule later tonight?
I've only been back for less than 24 hours and @TransLink has proven itself to be total ass once again
@TransLink @steeletalk @CKNW Will do - Next time I witness it.  I drive the route almost every day and have seen it multiple times - several callers on the radio show mentioned it as well.  The bus drivers can be hostile when asked about it at traffic lights - not sharing the road with other motorists.
@TransLink I got charged an extra fee by tapping out because I didn't tap in at my original station (King George) but the gates were open due to the power outage. What can I do to recover that fee I was charged?

@TransLink are there fewer buses for the 791 to Braid? It's been more than 40 min waiting at 57654 and no bus yet.
@TransLink So what’s the estimated time of arrival?
@TransLink what’s with the 99 not showing up to commercial and broadway?
@TransLink What’s with the scaffolding at Oakridge-41st? Is it for maintenance or the redevelopment?
@TransLink when will the next bus 337 at stop 61677 going to arrive.  this route is always late ... weather or no weather issues.

@TransLink We're waiting a very very long time on 96 &amp; 192 for a 501 Sry Central. Are there storm delays? Can't even see anything w/my GPS tracker.
@TransLink something banged the train in between 29 ave &amp; Nanaimo skytrain - east bound - a branch?
@TransLink Yes but I'm still wondering why it took so long. I've been outside waiting for 40 minutes?
@TransLink  5.36 pm. By Capilano mall. Bus 240 full..still Driver could have taken a mom and 2 kids..he said no.. Weather is not to great outside. Drivers seem don't have leeway these days.
@TransLink Status on the 375 near 20th and 152nd? @thenewsam is heading to Guildford for a movie!
"@TransLink is the 257 to Horseshoe Bay still running? The 5:35 was cancelled, but there’s a 5:55 on the schedule with no alerts posted (yet)"

Bus stop #55601"
@TransLink is the 157 still going by Austin and Marmont?
@TransLink Yikes! Thanks for the update.. how delayed are the 250s to horseshoe bay??
@TransLink  bus S15011 Guildford to newton was late. Left Guildford late.
This is the 96bline which is suppose to be reliable. I don’t understand why we had to wait for over 15 minutes for this bus and it was just there parking.
@TransLink Thanks for the quick replies! Made sure to let everyone waiting know ??
@TransLink any ideas about 136 lougheed at holdom stn? Time went from 6 min arrival to 28mins. ??
@TransLink was just on a 14 Hastings around Nanaimo that got into an accident. Driver did nothing wrong hmu if I need to make a statement but I’m walking home. Police already on scene I hope the driver isn’t too shaken up
@TransLink UPDATE: there’s a bus here now! Hooray!
@TransLink where is the 5.55 to white rock from Bridgeport? Why is this bus *always* late or cancelled when everything else is running to schedule?!
@SimonDyakowski @TransLink @steeletalk @CKNW Reason they drive in two lanes is to avoid any coalition with the parked cars (in case driver/passengers open their doors). This is called right side clearance....
@TransLink where's the 186 leaving Coquitlam station at 6:05?
@TransLink Yes! Luckily i was just about to leave and it arrived! Thx!
@TransLink Commuting around Greater Vancouver today has been challenging but Translink staff are clearly putting in extra effort and being helpful given the circumstances.
@TransLink I’m showing 211 from 50077 is delayed until 6:45? Is that correct?
@TransLink is the 791 eb coming? Been standing at my stop for an hour
@TransLink sad the 503 left early from 55714 stop.
@TransLink I caught a random 210 that showed up! But need the 211 eventually at phibbs. We shall see what happens!
@TransLink Yes. It is crowded but I got on. Thank you.

Hey @TransLink - is Skytrain free for passengers tonight? Just wondering since I can't drive anywhere to get food. ?
@TransLink 6:40 schedule is missing in action as well
@TransLink @steeletalk @CKNW You did absolutely nothing but raise ticket prices &amp;cause constant delays with buses. Why are there still no buses in Surrey running after 10pm on weekdays? Why can't you extend these hours for buses &amp; the train for customers who need it? Try listening to us &amp; do better in 2019.
"@TransLink Not really, traffic condition was good for 337. Also all other buses come a few times already."
"I'll say one thing about the #BCStorm, @TransLink buses don't seem to mind. Just experienced a bus swerving around a fallen tree like we were in a fast and furious movie... ???"

@TransLink @TransLink stalled outside of YVR too
@TransLink Dang stalled in Vancouver city centre
@TransLink @Ranalletta Trains sitting at downtown Canada Line station as well.
@TransLink The doors opened and I got the heck off. I assume it is fine now
@TransLink No it hasn’t been cleared.
@TransLink Ha. No. But I appreciate your optimism.
@TransLink how long are the Canada line delays? Hoping to get to airport
@TransLink what’s going on with Canada Line? Update!!
@TransLink Still stuck ? 
@TransLink Still stuck at Olympic Stn.
@TransLink Then why are the trains not moving? Can't you go around the stalled train? Would be slow but at least the trains would be moving.
"@TransLink i meant 6:40 PM schedule, but thanks forthe response, so 6:33 decided to cancel, what happened to 6:40PM and 6:48PM schedule?"
@TransLink Why can't you go around the stalled train? Single lane alternating the direction of the trains passing by?
@TransLink What about busses going eastbound on 41st? 30mins between busses?
@TransLink @TransLink why can't you stop the train at a station so we have the option to get off?
"@krisinda @TransLink I'm coming, Babe!"
#Canadaline experiencing technical problems. Nothing moving right now. Any updates @TransLink?

"On the skytrain, one stop from the airport, and the train won't move!

@TransLink you tweet the issue is resolved but the trains weren't moving. Then you say there is a delay but the trains had started moving again. Now you announce the issue is resolved but the trains stop moving. Do you see the problem with this?
Hi @TransLink quick question; I will need to take public transportation on Boxing Day. How is it gonna work with the zones ?? Thanks

"@Rogue951 @shanna_d88 @TransLink Potentially be more open with the public, instead of saying it will be fixed soon, and then saying twenty minutes later to find alternative routes to your destinations.

@TransLink did something happen again to the 5:18 159 at stop 53026? Second time this week it hasn’t shown up?
@TransLink Greetings! Wanted to say I heard Kevin Desmond on Linda Steele yesteeday. Thought he did great job being open &amp; direct. Also kudos to him for taking callers.
"@TransLink Oh darn okay, that sucks. Thank you for the quick reply! Have a great day ?"

"@TransLink Just so you're aware (&amp; can let the right people know), the 746 just skipped past stop 57931 and the entire road therein. Likely because it was running late. Might want to have a transit supervisor check in with that particular driver."
"@TransLink Thanks, I appreciate that! There were around 4 ppl at this particular stop that might be late for work, lol."
"@TransLink Yeah that's totally possible; the passengers in this area are usually really good at helping new drivers, at least! :)"
@TransLink @TheBlurryBear Don’t driver get route training? They used too.
@TransLink your skytrains have no place for bags and just take up seats . Time to get with it 
"@TransLink no #133 at #52761... Both Google, Transit and your site said it was to be there. If you'd check the gps you'd find it probably is running early. Thank you for making another unhappy customer."
@TransLink Will it hit 57529? Haven't seen a bus here yet...
@TransLink A bus should never leave before it's scheduled time. Otherwise why have a schedule in the first place.
@TransLink @TransLink are the Ladner buses not coming down 46A Street? Stop 57529?
@kim_crawley It was wild yesterday 
@TransLink Are you serious? You're a transit company that doesn't even dare to enter into a contract with its customers on their transit times? I guess also in BC public transport is not the solution for increasing traffic congestion.
@TransLink Thanks. Make sure a supervisor gets down to 57529 to put a sign up. Otherwise people will be standing there for an hour.
"@silent_node @TransLink Hey, sorry to upset you. It's hard to take twitter seriously and I wrote this tweet using the vernacular of my peers and my audience, and this tweet has reached a lot of people that don't fall into those groups. Sorry my language wasn't proper."
@TransLink is the Expo line running?
Not cool with signal issues on West Coast Express Train 3 this morning. So frustrating for commuters when the rail line knows the West Coast Express schedule. Pretty Grinchy CP. #translink @TransLink #CPRail

@AnthonyFloyd @TransLink So it sorts properly.
"@TransLink Ok, thanks!"
@AnthonyFloyd @TransLink Transit times are now sponsored by Apple iPhone models.
@translink I love the WCE.  They just congratulated someone on her last ride into town as she is retiring.  Awesome.
@AnthonyFloyd @TransLink Someone in accounting clearly got really persnickety about having two blocks of ‘am’ in the same workday. The use of it in a public facing venue is just… dumb.
@WriterStrategy @TransitPolice @TransLink He offered a lump of coal and a chance for a selfie. Lol
@TransLink every morning between 8 to 8:10 3 22 buses come together with no more than 10 people each and now I have to wait til 8:30 for the next one?? What’s the excuse for this bad frequency??
@TransLink very frustrated &amp; disappointed! Had to wait 30mins last night for the #10 Bus on a Weekday! While all others buses drove by. We just had two fare increases. Bus drivers &amp; signs says scheduled are every 15mins! This has happened on numerous occasions! ?

@TransLink what happened to the 2 bus???? Been waiting for almost half ab hour for a bus and the line up has like 30 people already... id # 50072
@TransLink Yes the next 744 picked me up. Was informed that u no longer pick up at bay 5 except when going to meadowtown ctr. New pick up is across parking lot infront of bathroom. Perhaps u should change the sign to reflect this!!!!

@TransLink  thanks
@ash_amlani @amoralorealis @WestVanDistrict @TransLink thanks for your reply Ash. But... no way no how. I travel that route every day. Simply a non truth. Really inconsequential though. The B line proposal is not the answer. I would rather see marine drive closed completely
@TransLink Thanks one eventually showed up.
@TransLink Right back at you! ??

@TransLink Yes I am on it. Thanks
@TransLink We are moving now. Ps can you pass on that the driver is awesome? So many grumpy riders and she handled it so well!
@TransLink Any idea why the 6:40 601 from Bridgeport is MIA?
@TransLink where is the 301?? It was supposed to leave Newton Exchange at 6:35
"@TransLink what are the West Coast Express train times from Waterfront on xmas eve?
Thanks."
@TransLink The 620 just pulled away empty at the ferry terminal when we walked up. There was another one right after but shocked that an empty bus would pull away after seeing passengers walk up on a busy holiday travel night. Now some people will have to wait. Disappointing.
@TransLink ummm...our train overshot the Sea Island Centre stop and we are now stuck on the track?
@TransLink This bus driver is really trying to fit everyone in but this is really unfair and ridiculous. They had to leave fifteen people behind for 45 minutes longer.

@TransLink what is going on with the bus 151?
@TransLink What a fucking joke...useless service providers.

@TransLink really frustrated when local transit service isnt reliable. Especially when you have a doctor's appointment but now you can't make it on time. Not my fault bus came by 10 minutes early. What's the point of a schedule then?
@TransLink I've submitted a complaint but this is just pointless for users who actually try and make the scheduled times. What's the point if you're going to ignore that? Leave people waiting an hour for service?
@TransLink If I feel for feedback then what? Is there any accountability on @TransLink part for this?
@TransLink Yes! Thank you for more 23!

"Hey @TransLink — it’s frustrating for a crowd of transit riders to get off the seabus, rush to the #236 to Grouse Mountain &amp; see the bus drive away as we get within sight. I presume you coordinate the bus departures with seabus landings... did the driver leave early?"
"Enter for a chance to win a pair of tickets to watch the #WorldJuniors in #Vancouver, courtesy of @TransLink and @HockeyCanada "
@DavidChenTweets @ProVancouverHQ Apparently @TransLink is doing a trial on e-buses that super-charge within 5mins. I don't know the tech of the battery make-up. Plus #Vanpoli has E-car charging stations installed by the city using Hydro #vanre #bcpoli #richmondBC #burnaby #poco #langleybc 
@TransLink bus 17534 was showing 373 Surrey central Express?? What does the express mean
"@themediagal @DavidChenTweets @ProVancouverHQ @TransLink Hydrogen fuel cells require more energy to generate and store energy, costlier infrastructure.

Battery storage systems continue to evolve, solid state looks promising for energy density.

Existing grid can be utilized with transformers and adaptors

"
@dvnmntgmry @TransLink @HockeyCanada No.
"@TransLink We were near the front of the crowd from the seabus, so I suspect no one made the connection. Instant lineup for the next one. You should consider adding at least a few extra minutes to that connection. Few things more frustrating than rushing &amp; seeing the bus drive away."
"@qlee50 @DavidChenTweets @ProVancouverHQ @TransLink There's a long way to go w/battery manufacturing so that it can be something that lasts 20 years. I really don't know how to do that, however the generators at hydro dams just need to be replaced to be able to store higher amounts of energy for a longer period. They last 100 yrs."
"@qlee50 @themediagal @ProVancouverHQ @TransLink While I agree that battery tech is getting better, instant refueling suits more people &amp; industry needs better. I go on trips off-grid with a 4x4 &amp; any rechargeable technology is useless for off-grid use. There is a reason the military is looking at hydrogen fuel cell technology"
@DavidChenTweets @qlee50 @ProVancouverHQ @TransLink I don't why military would choose hydrogen tech since it's a volatile gas.
"@DavidChenTweets @themediagal @ProVancouverHQ @TransLink You make a good point, hydrogen makes sense for rural and remote locations for military use cases

But domestic and daily applications are better served by electric if the battery can provide a full utilization cycle where travel is overwhelmingly under 200km"

@TransLink Maybe you guys should post the cancelled trips on your twitter account prior to opening the desk or when the first bus is scheduled. This common occurrence of “operational issues” has been of the norm lately. @CTVNews @CTVVancouver @GlobalBC @globalnews
@TransLink busses that pass their stop 6 minutes before their scheduled time is just spitting in the face of your customers.
@TransLink I truly believe the drivers of #133 and #144 should be told that an early morning bus needs to pick up passengers. Driving by an empty stop 5 minutes before the schedule is just unacceptable and a token of unreliability.

@TransLink Good morning! The Lamar screens at Main St SkyTrain seem to have been frozen on this image and ticker for a couple of days. 
It's so great when at the end of a 10 hour graveyard shift the 123 bus decides this stop isn't important and moves two lanes over before just driving right by me. @TransLink
@TransLink just a question but is there a fare breakdown for add fare for monthly pass holders? The compass website says that the amount is automatically deducted but doesn’t explain how that amount is calculated.
@TransLink is NYE a sunday/stat schedule??
@TransLink any problems with the 49 this morning to UBC

@TransLink Is it okay if my older brother who never uses his compass card gives it to me? The card has $15.40 on it.
Hi @TransLink :) not sure if it’s under your purview but there was a seagull stuck for a while by glass fence on mid store level of marine dr stn—wondering if some bird stickers etc might help in future as it kept flying into the glass trying to get through (it’s free now though)

@TransLink Well what’s going on we have been sitting west bound on a train now for about five min now at Edmonds. Westbound going nowhere
@TransLink No announcements at stations. You guys are total gems with the circulation of information.
@TransLink Millennium line is affected as well....
@TransLink Don't know why a train stuck at Braid is causing delays at King George. I'd really like to get to work on time.
@TransLink somebody gonna let us know why we’re just sitting at holdom station for awhile now soon
@TransLink Why is train stalled in Braid station affecting the millennium line?? Other alternatives to get to downtown?
@TransLink That sucks. Be nice if there would be an announcement. ..lots of people on the train at Sperling is getting antsy
@TransLink is there going to be a westbound train at Sapperton any time soon? Or should we take a train to Production Way?
@TransLink Brother needs to get to airport to catch a flight - should he call a cab instead? Any idea how much of a delay?

@rwittstock @ash_amlani @mrmathewbond @jonathanxcote @jessicamcilroy @BowinnMa @npachal @PJNewWest @TransLink @Khelsilem I've made transportation decisions based on total transit cost vs. gas + parking + convenience. I started riding the bus less once I had to pay the fairs for my kids - sometimes it just doesn't make sense financially. Plus on the #northshore car often wins for fast easy cheap.

"Yes, this??. Even though vehicle ownership cost is much more than fuel, the decision in most cases is time/convenience/cost/comfort of ""car vs. transit"". But any dramatic shift would increase transit demand &amp; costs WHILE REDUCING CONGESTION, GHGs, FUTURE ROAD/BRIDGE COST."

Hey @TransLink I know it's not the social media teams decision but it absolutely infuriates me every NYE that you can't extend Skytrain hours past 2 am for one day a year. We have no rideshare in this city and taxis are impossible to get on NYE. 2 am on NYE is nothing.

@TransLink Okay thank you
@TransLink Why?
This article describes the woeful service @translink provides in Maple Ridge to a T! In Maple you wait for an hour for local service on weekdays and up to two hours on weekends. Maple Ridge needs more than just a B-Line to Coquitlam and back! #bcpoli  
@TransLink There's what seems to be poop (smells like it anyways but it's liquid as well as solid) near an elevator at Langara-49 Station?
@TransLink hello!  Someone dropped bbt on the skytrain at yaletown roundhouse towards YVR - car 203 by the stretchy bit ??
@TransLink No where in your original tweet did you mention the route 100 and it looked like all routes were going to be using Bay 2 instead of Bay 1 which would only relocate the problem
@TransLink Just wondering why the 119 stop at Metrotown was moved? Both the 112 and 129 barely use Metrotown so I don't see the need/benefit and associated costs of moving it and having to update station maps.

@TransLink what’s happening with the 26 Joyce bus? Waiting at stop 58249 for almost 40 mins
Big shoutout to @TransLink and @MyVancouver for offering FREE bus rides after 5pm on NYE til 5am NYD. Safer for all and easier too!! #supportpublictransit
Hey if the bus never comes do you mind if I send you the taxi receipt @TransLink? It's no problem you can just email transfer me later ??
@TransLink What time is the first train heading to Waterfront tomorrow?
@TransLink I will be leaving from Commercial and Broadway
@TransLink Hello. Do you have first train from Richmond at 5:02 am? What time is the first train from Richmond tomorrow? Dec 31st?
@Cazzy @TransLink Yes.
"@eakin_daniel @TransLink Probably to trigger the turn signal, that's what it sounds like, since the placement of the stop isn't great for that."
"??????????????? (@ Yaletown - Roundhouse SkyTrain Station - @translink in Vancouver, BC) "
@TransLink Goodnight
@TransLink @TransLink This is great because the 100 is quite busy most times. Is there possibility of adding multiple bays based on space capacity because of the multiple routes stopping there. I know there is multi stop boarding at Bay 1 but for wayfinding it’s easier to have multiple bays
Holy fuck if I ever find the guy who organised @translink I’m gonna slap the fuck outta him
"@TRIUMFLab @TransLink @UBC Drove by those trees and never knew.  The variety is called ""Flower of Kent"".  Apparently the trees in @NRC_CNRC Ottawa were tested and were not.  Fortunately the @yorkuniversity sent them offsprings of their Newton Trees.

@TransLink Is sky train running on holiday hours?
@TransLink What time does the free bus time start
@TransLink Thank you!
@TransLink To what time will trains start tomorrow then 7.08 I guess
@TransLink Looking out my window you could have even done away with a few less. Nobody on them. Haven’t seen a soul on the KG ones and the Waterfront ones have less than a car full through the train. But it will get busy later
@TransLink You as well! Happy New Year
@TransLink 06:32 Marine Station #17 Downtown missing again this morning.  Again. #fail #wheresmybus #10yearscam
"Seriously, @TransLink needs to turn the temperature of the buses down a bit. People are bundled up against the cold, it’s like being inside your house with your winter jacket on and the heat cranked. It’s suffocating! Shucking your coat off isn’t always an option."
@TransLink 55570. Thanks!
As a former bus driver and Transit Supervisor with @TransLink I urge you to take advantage of their FREE transportation beginning at 5:00 P.M. this evening.  Please don't drink and drive.  #HappyNewYear2019

@TransLink Some of your drivers should learn compassion. I ran to catch the 101 #17 bus because it was 2 minutes early and the driver argued with me to come on time because there’s “no school so it’s going to come early.” What kind of excuse is this? He was SO rude!

@TransLink please have the Canada line train going to YVR cleaned up before being used by the passengers from the airport. The train # is 120.

@VancouverPD @TransLink Free is nice. But a 2 hour transit ride and a 20 minute walk down a street with few lights is not nice. Spending the money. Will look for a taxi home.
"@yvryimby @mrmathewbond @Khelsilem @nlamontagne @jennmeilleur @jessicamcilroy @rwittstock @ash_amlani @jonathanxcote @BowinnMa @npachal @PJNewWest @TransLink @humantransit I used to think that transit should be free for everyone, but subsidized transit leads to inefficiencies in that transit system. Outside of low-income user who should be subsidized, the system should be paid and be run off of the ridership. However, we need a road tax for drivers"

I don't think a road tax happens anytime soon, just look at the revolt over tolls and how the NDP wound up running on a platform to remove the tolls altogether."
"@Khelsilem @nlamontagne @mrmathewbond @jennmeilleur @jessicamcilroy @yvryimby @rwittstock @ash_amlani @jonathanxcote @BowinnMa @npachal @PJNewWest @TransLink @humantransit And it would have been correct there, too!"

"Thanks for the reminder @CityofVancouver. If you are driving into the city tonight, pls consider carpooling with a designated driver as parking will be hard to find. You might want to try parking further away &amp; walking or taking transit to get to your destination. #VPD #NYE2018"

@mrmathewbond @Khelsilem @nlamontagne @jennmeilleur @jessicamcilroy @yvryimby @rwittstock @ash_amlani @jonathanxcote @BowinnMa @npachal @TransLink @humantransit The other obvious difference is the  impact of transportation cost/availability on community development patterns. Free abundant transport to far suburbs will incite unsustainable sprawl which has far-reaching negative externalities.

"
@TransLink Thanks! King George
@TransLink Thank you!

"@BourryYang @Khelsilem @nlamontagne @jennmeilleur @jessicamcilroy @yvryimby @rwittstock @ash_amlani @jonathanxcote @BowinnMa @npachal @PJNewWest @TransLink @humantransit Hypothetically, the difference from status quo is that if you had the wealth and wanted to pollute more, you would be paying for the societal/environmental impacts, whereas now you don’t. 

But that’s a long way down the rabbit hole on a one tweet hypothetical transport system"
@TransLink are there traffic snags on Kingsway? 2 19s are no show at Windsor NB
"@mrmathewbond @Khelsilem @nlamontagne @jennmeilleur @jessicamcilroy @yvryimby @rwittstock @ash_amlani @jonathanxcote @BowinnMa @npachal @PJNewWest @TransLink @humantransit Yeah, we need to get away from this idea that it's okay to pollute if you pay for it."
"@TransLink Thanks, I knew it had to be something!!"
@TransLink @meganleect Um the 95 don't have the stickers 
@TransLink is the bus free as well?
@TransLink @marghernandez_ How about refunding her fare? That’d be neat. ??
"Just wishing everyone a festive evening, however you plan to ring in the New Year. Don’t drink and drive. Remember,  @TransLink transit services are free tonight! "

@TransLink And do the trains run later tonight?
@TransLink Wow
@TransLink What time is the last train from Waterfront to Richmond Brighouse? Will there be extended hours tonight?
@TransLink Awesome! Thanks! The link was hard to find (maybe I just missed it tho) so I suggest tweeting it out if you havnt yet :) 
@TransLink Is this bus to?
"I'm at Waterfront Station - @translink in Vancouver, British Columbia "
.@TransLink is savage. Just watched as a train packed to the gills arrived at Waterfront terminus and as families were offloading the doors slammed and separated a bunch of people from the rest of their groups then took off lol. Should probably add extra time during peak usage.

"@mrmathewbond @jennmeilleur @jonathanxcote @jessicamcilroy @BowinnMa @npachal @PJNewWest @TransLink @Khelsilem At this time $600M a year are likely better spent on pedestrian &amp; cycling infrastructure, which is generally much cheaper to provide than transit. Subsidizing specific transit user groups would make more sense to me, e.g. free transit for kids."
@TransLink It’s stop at Patterson station

"@Literalus @TransLink @car2goVancouver @BCFerries @ParkBoard @cbcnewsbc Simplest solution i can think of is the equip a few buses with ""leashed pet areas"" and add them to the schedule.

Now you know why the pitch forks and torches are coming out over here Martyn.  The Village issue is just as bad... hopefully they find a better solution."
@pwatkins63 @TransLink @CamNFox @TheClosures I suspect that one of the reasons the details may change is that there’s another public input session coming up this month. Isn’t that what you want?
"@martynschmoll @TransLink @CamNFox @TheClosures Absolutely, but I'm not expecting much.  This has already been approved by the Mayors Council and imo the District as well.

"@TransLink this is absolutely ridiculous. Bay 1 and 2 are fairly far apart, so why has this change happened?

@TransLink sometimes the 236 bus at lonsdale quay just sits through a departure time (e.g. 5:32p this evening). Is there reason for this? How can riders learn of this and plan for it?
@TransLink The last two busses to go by filled up. The entire bus had to exit and they did not let us wait inside. There's still a large number of people at the 95 stop on hastings and main
@TransLink Now three full..
"@TransLink To get home I can take the 10 Downtown or 100 Marpole, I take whichever gets there first because I just want to get home.

@TransLink  update on #555 bus from Lougheed center please. The line up to wait is by the cofeee shop.  Please advise.
@TransLink. What's up with the 44UBC out of downtown?   Been 30 minutes now.
@TransLink today is the second day in a row the 19 to Stanley park didn’t show up according to schedule. Any idea where you have a current schedule that’s actually accurate?
@TransLink well 25 mins and it finally showed at georgia. Now leaving people behind at the next stop for the 44
@jeffrichards @TransLink When I went through there was 12’pokice cars.  Hope everyone was ok
@cityjada @TransLink I am in for all these modes!!!
@cityjada @TransLink So many sweet ideas!
@TransLink been at the king george bus stop waiting for 395 for an hour already. ??????
"I had to watch Petey go down on the Expo Line.  Brutal.  

@TransLink #Canucks "
@TransLink wheres the 395? GET ?YOUR ?SHIT ?TOGETHER TRANSLINK ?
@TransLink So are y’all gonna charge me extra now on my compass card as the time limit for my whole trip is more than 90 mins already. ?
@TransLink I managed to hop on board Marky (429-432) today!!! When did this newest member of the fleet enter into service? 
"Hi @TransLink - amazing reflexes from the driver of 2258 WB #9 at Granville just now: kept us safe while a terrible driver cut us off from the left lane with a right turn _in front of us_. Thanks for driving safe, especially in this weather."
@TransLink And whats that gonna do? Because I’ve been told to do that multiple times yet nothings been done. ?
"@TransLink Royal Oak station, just outside the faregates, there's this massive puddle because of a clogged drain. shoes soaked, please unclog"
"@TransLink - Could I please request for a Bus Shelter at the WB stop on the corner of Lougheed Hwy &amp; Schoolhouse Rd in #Coquitlam? Bus comes at 30min intervals and is surrounded by businesses, movie theater, and the Ministry of Transportation building. It’s a busy stop. Thx."
@TransLink Can’t Translink make the bus stop poles in the shape of a bus shelter? ? Thanks for the information. I’ll probably be back when the City of Coquitlam tells me it’s Translink’s responsibility.
@TransLink 159 going to braid going to stop at Poco station? Or did it ignore the stop? 53348
I took that picture about 15 minutes ago at Granville stn and you're saying thousands of commuters piled onto trains in that amount of time? Ridiculous! @TransLink @TransitPolice @clairetrevena
@TransLink I am in customer service. You guys are doing it VERY VERY wrong
"On a lighter note, @TransLink this guy really loves his rat on the bus! Lol "
@TransLink PLEASE be clear I am NOT complaining about the wait. Waits on major transit routes are to be expected. I am complaining about being LIED to by your company time and time again.
"@TransLink Hahaha You are not understanding me. I don't care about waiting. I care about being LIED to via an overhead speaker over and over again. If you were stuck in a room how would you feel hearing ""Sorry for the delay, the door will open shortly"" over and over again??!!"
@TransLink Waiting at lougheed station for expo line to waterfront. 3 straight larforge trains come through. What gives?
"@TransLink Just tell us what is REALLY going on.  ""Sorry guys, the line is screwed and you might be stuck where you are for 20 plus minutes, but we are trying our best"".  NO ONE would complain about that!!!"
@TransLink Does that make sense??
"@TransLink ""I don't have all the answers""! Oh man, yer reading from a script!! Lol Nevermind. I'll just drive"
@TransLink Sad since we need professionals like me to park and take transit. Translink's juvenile and moronic handling of customers service is standing in the way. #fucktranslink
@TransLink Waited 15 minutes just for a waterfront train to show up #fail #fixyourschedule
@TransLink I just witnessed a bus driver of the Boundary N99 trap a ladies leg in the front door and refuse to open it. I get that it must be frustrating to be a driver at peak times but this was completely uncalled for and unprofessional. You should be ashamed of this employee.
"@TransLink On the plus side, the driver of the Boundary N99 that I got on was one of the most pleasant drivers I have ever experienced. He spotted a mother and child trying to get on at the busy back door and got off the bus to guide them to the front. Hire more people like him!"
@TransLink HOLY COW THE 123 in New West was actually ready before the 106!!! WOW!! ??????????
"Glad to hear! It will be wonderful to have a facility that better meets the needs of regional transit users but also a better ""welcome"" to the North Shore for visitors that arrive by seabus

#transit #seabus #northvan"
@TransLink    Please tell us you’ll are able to fix the issues with the 335 busses. Again no bus showed at 6:00 and the line up at Gateway is more than a bus full.  Busses are passing by with sorry Bus Full.  I’m sure you’ll must receive10000’s of compaints.  Please fix this
@TransLink  heavy rush at Surrey metro station . Kindly increase frequency of 502 to Langley centre. Waiting is more than half an hour
@EMSbasesstudent @TransLink Lol ?
@TransLink Central to Guildford. Thanks
Has OOMF ever done public transit to the Peace Arch border from the BC side? Looks like you  can get to King George @ 8th on the @TransLink 375 then it’s just about an 8 block walk to the States? Google says walk back 3km to White Rock but can’t you just walk the Hwy99 shoulder?
@TransLink But this is a regular occurrence at this time.  ??
"@TransLink Thanks for getting back to me. Waits weren't that bad, just really crowded trains."
@TransLink Maybe during peak time you need to increase frequency further as this also is resulting at heavy rush ...
@TransLink The 6:04 was late as usual and full. So was the next one
On new bus. There's a squatty potty seat! #transit @TransLink 
@TransLink Link provided by you is not working
"@BowinnMa @TransLink An easy decision in an NDP riding, yet the Massey Tunnel continues to be delayed, perhaps its between two Liberal ridings."
"@chester_p_c @TransLink The track isn’t owned by Translink, rather by CP rail. Though they have a contract giving WCE trains passage through their tracks, freight trains get priority. Translink can’t do anything about this."
"@BowinnMa @TransLink This is great news! Any plans to include additional bicycle storage to support more multi-modal transportation? We’d love to be able to ride to the Quay, securely park our bikes, and board the #Seabus. 
@CityOfNorthVan"
@TransLink do you have an end date to this expo track maintenance and is there any schedule for next week?
"@zachariah_jtv @TransLink Sorry dude, I was just spamming their feed due to their lack of reply to me and my overall displeasure with their continued use of vague purposely placating loud-speaker explanations of current situations. Peace."
@TransLink No problem. Was on the train near 22nd and confused is all. Not that bad a delay.
"@MTA @NYCTBus you should learn something from @TransLinkSEQ @TrainLinkSouth @TransLink about infants safety on the bus. @MTA are you implying that all the other companies endanger their passengers??

"@TransLink Hi there! If I have came across some Faresaver Tickets (pre-Compass cards), are they still useful or straight on to recycling? ????"
@TransLink Woohoo! Thanks so much!
"@tonyvalente_ca Realized I should ask you this question, too! I know cycling is important to you! @HUBnorthshore"
"@bjcjapan Good point! I have heard others express interest in bike lockers, bike racks would also be a no brainer. I haven't seen any schematics yet but I'll try to find something and reach out to @TransLink if needed"
@jessicamcilroy @TransLink Fantastic! I literally just bought a new bike so this has been in my mind. ?
"Between this bracelet and the @TransLink bracelet, I bet the future includes a pretty rowdy arm party."
"@soundslikepuget @TransLink I haven’t noticed any pedestrians, or signs banning pedestrians on 99. But I’m also not surprised that there’s no good bus route to the border, we don’t even have a BLI drop off that doesn’t require any walking."
"Actually, maybe @BowinnMa has seen the details?? I did learn today though that the drop off/pick up area is called a ""Kiss and Ride""!"
"@shipyardsgreg As this is the gateway into the Shipyards District and our City, I’m excited to have this area renovated and refreshed #welcome #northvan @CityOfNorthVan @TransLink @mylowerlonsdale"
"@TransLink  Have I mentioned how much this track maintenance since July SUCKS for the late night workers on the Expo/Millenium line?! Always packed, never consistent times. I think our PM rides should be free because this is poor service."
"@oliviajennieb @TransLink There is (or was) a @ridewta bus to the Sumas border but I am going the other way. I have a business trip in Toronto, then a flight to @yvrairport, then meeting my ride in @city_of_Blaine WA for a vacation on Whidbey Island WA USA. I gotta get to #PeaceArch"
@TransLink @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @CityOfNorthVan Renovation begins next month and will be completed late 2019. I’m surprised that isn’t worked out yet...
"@bjcjapan @BowinnMa @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan I haven’t seen the final plans. I know from my days @HUBnorthshore it was being considered, but space will be at a premium with #bikeshare coming soon too."
@tonyvalente_ca @BowinnMa @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @HUBnorthshore Pretty excited about #bikeshare too...!
"@soundslikepuget @TransLink @ridewta @yvrairport @City_of_Blaine Dude, I’ll just come pick you up at the airport."
"@soundslikepuget @TransLink @ridewta @yvrairport @City_of_Blaine Otherwise, I’d say a private bus line to Bellingham."
@martynschmoll @TransLink @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @CityOfNorthVan We asked for secure bike parking at Lonsdale Quay for some time and most recently last fall. No plans to include secure bike parking with this upgrade that we are aware of. @LindaCBuchanan @WeAreHub
@HUBnorthshore @martynschmoll @TransLink @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @CityOfNorthVan @WeAreHub I will ask.
@tonyvalente_ca @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @HUBnorthshore Has anybody at TransLink talked to ICBC to use space in their building for secure bike parking?
@tonyvalente_ca @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @HUBnorthshore I could really use secure bike parking at Seabus tomorrow. Will drive instead ?
@LindaCBuchanan @HUBnorthshore @martynschmoll @TransLink @BowinnMa @CityOfNorthVan @WeAreHub Thank you all!
"Finally, the waterfront entrance for commuters and tourists to our City will compliment our exciting new Shipyards District! #NorthVan @CityOfNorthVan"
@soundslikepuget @TransLink @ridewta @yvrairport @City_of_Blaine Island Transit is free and relatively often from Bellingham all the way to whidbey.
"@oliviajennieb @TransLink @ridewta @yvrairport @City_of_Blaine Oh that’s so sweet of you. My husband has a business trip to Blaine and will have Enterprise rental car there, I just need to get from YVR airport to Blaine. There is a shuttle for $110 CAD, $84 USD. I’ll probably do that and work will reimburse but I wanted to explore transit"

@CityofVancouver @TransLink  has no booth collector. Very hostile for tourists. Can't ask for directions. Assumes literate &amp; anglophone. Can't buy or ask how to buy transit fare. Need $6 Compass card to use the SkyTrain. #Toronto #TTC removing booth collectors #TOpoli
@TransLink new route today for the 182?  ????? 
@HUBnorthshore @TransLink @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @CityOfNorthVan @LindaCBuchanan @WeAreHub That’s what I suspect.
@TransLink We were standing at 53287 but luckily checked NextBus to see that the driver made a wrong turn so walked down to 59100 to catch the 183.  Not that easy for many others along Ravine Dr to do so.   Why are we always getting new drivers or those unable to understand what a schedule?
"@TransLink Remember when the WCE train 5 was full before Coquitlam on Black Friday &amp; no one at Waterfront was prepared for it?
You may want to confirm with train 5 again today as it looks like the 1st 3 cars are close to capacity 10 minutes before departure."
@TransLink The issue is inexperienced drivers lacking confidence who can’t follow route instructions or keep a schedule.  Filing in your form to not see any action is not something that I should have to do.  Check the GPS records and compare to schedule says it all.
"@stuartd37 @BowinnMa @TransLink The riding should not matter, it should be what is best for commuters. Disastrous leadership."
Where did the 130 from metro @ 7:24 go?? @TransLink
@TransLink Thanks. Was the 7:23 bus cancelled today too? Because it never showed up.
@TransLink It has run late almost every morning I’ve taken it for the past week and a half ?
@TransLink why is the heat on in the train. It’s 10 degrees out. In rush hour heat isn’t needed. Car 126 expo line to waterfront.
@TransLink how is the 555 going westbound. I know there is quite a bit of traffic on hwy 1 in Coquitlam and Burnaby.
"Wet slow commute on #Hwy1 westbound but one tip, if you drive a small car don’t suddenly cut left into the #HOV lane in front of a @TransLink bus. Thankfully not another crash @kaitlynherbst16 @GlobalBC "
Also if you drive a large commercial vehicle don't drive in the left lane! That's what started this whole mess #drivingtips
@TransLink Haven’t left home yet. But I will be at the 156 street hwy 1 stop going westbound
@TransLink is 28 not supposed to reroute through McGill right now?
@stuartd37 @BowinnMa @TransLink The bus loop also serves perhaps more passengers from 2 adjacent BC Liberal ridings. There's also a huge difference in cost per passenger moved between a Massey Tunnel replacement and the refurbishing of a bus loop.
"@AntjeWahl @tonyvalente_ca @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @HUBnorthshore There are thousands - no exaggeration - of bike parking spots at train stations in London, and even with their less safe roads, bikes are heavily used getting to and from train stations. It makes eminent sense."
@TransLink 335 yo surrey central going by Bus Full. Put more busses on this route
"Good morning @TransLink! Assuming buses are slightly off schedule, what is the best way to find out when they are ACTUALLY coming? The transit app tells me two minutes, and Google maps tells me five minutes, and the official schedule says it should have been here one minute ago."
@BowinnMa @TransLink Yay! It’s kinda dark and creepy down there right now
@TransLink Window doesn’t open. It was so warm someone passed out. That’s ridiculous
@tonyvalente_ca @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan @HUBnorthshore Bike storage at the quay would be amazing. Doesn’t have to be right by the terminal. But something around there.
@TransLink two 49 buses westbound at Fraser St full again and likely more to come so I have given up. Need more buses!
@TransLink when are you planning to open the new platform at Commercial-Broadway? thanks.. and do you have a diagram of the intended flows?
@TransLink how long is the up escalator at commercial platforms 1 &amp; 2 going to be out of service? The website doesn't mention anything
@TransLink So what's up with the skytrain? 6 trains in a row going to coq center and only one to waterfront 930 in morning and bus 9548 stops the bus at a coffee shop for almost 10mins...
@TransLink 8:34 
@TransLink I gave up and drove. Too many full buses. Too many late arrivals at work.
@HUBnorthshore @martynschmoll @TransLink @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @CityOfNorthVan @LindaCBuchanan @WeAreHub Yet they tore apart Lynn Valley road to develop bike lanes...it's like one hand doesn't know what the other is doing?
"@TransLink AGAIN, TODAY!  &amp; i don’t need to fill out a lengthy form telling you my 2018 tax return &amp; first born childs name 2 leave a comment/complaint. It’s ridiculous! Twitter is a perfectly viable forum to relay that info. We need more busses! @CityofVancouver @kennedystewart #banairbnb"
"@TransLink so now I'm late for work,  84 bus 9548 stop at a coffee shop and then drives so slow that another 84 laps him.  WTF! At morning rush hr.  Guy should be fired!"
@TransLink waiting at stop 57143 and the 503 bus is...really really late lol. Any chance I can get an eta?
"@TransLink No worries, thanks for the update! Have a great shift :)"
@nwoodsyvr @HUBnorthshore @TransLink @bjcjapan @BowinnMa @CityOfNorthVan @LindaCBuchanan @WeAreHub It’s obvious there’s no clear strategy to support and enable multi-modal options on the North Shore at this time. Even the potential added safety of those bike lanes on Lynn Valley Road is watered down as @NVanDistrict removes delineators for winter months (last year Nov - Jun).
"@TransLink I’m at stop 55999, any word on the 342 that was supposed to leave at 9:11?"
@TransLink there is a coffee spill on one of the seats on car 056 heading towards waterfront....next stop Royal oak
@TransLink Do you plan on updating the display signs inside 401-420? I was on the recent Mark 3 &amp; 432 had a display sign that said something like “Next Station” (didn’t see this on the other Mark 3 I was on a couple of days ago) ?
@TransLink the bus rider of 17536 didn’t stop when a passenger pulled the rope in front of KPS then again didn’t stop at the second one and said he didn’t pull it I saw that the one that want off did pull it. He was kind of rude
"@TransLink why is Nanaimo loop closed?  there’s no trucks, no workers, no construction. ??"
@TransLink @jjhorgan This link leads to a dead page.
@CitizenYan @TransLink #notactualpotty
Great news!
"@TransLink ah, i didn’t realize it was@so extensive. thanks!"
@BowinnMa @jodyvance @TransLink Try reading the report Ms Ma.  Any transit improvements are a result of the Mayors 10yr plan not INSTPP. It just fiddled around the edges of change and rejected conclusions of Stephan Nieweler.  Why?  
"@TransLink are the new busses properly stop-start? This is cool, although I keep thinking something might be wrong every time we stop at a light ?"
"@TransLink heads up, theres a lady on the millenium and 99 route today that is approaching people of Asian descent and making derogatory generalizations. (Approx. 11:15-11:30 am)"
@TransLink @ChristianColqu3 I found the stop annoying. It was like the old days with a standard transmission and you’d forget to put in the clutch at a stop
@TransLink There’s a woman harassing passengers with racist taunts on transit. She got on at Brentwood and got off at Commercial dr. She harassed at least 2 passengers. Where should I report this?
@TransLink I appreciate the reply.
@TransLink Hey is the 44 not running today? Its missed two times in a row at #58099...
@TransLink @TransitPolice Thank you!
.@TransLink  fuck you.
"@TransLink When you tap a Visa instead of a Compass card, take a 1 zone trip, and are charged $5.70...
Does the difference for the trip get refunded back onto the Visa?"
@j_holtslander @TransLink It should be refunded when you tap out at the end of your train journey
"@TransLink @TransitPolice Hopefully I won’t have to, but yes I’ll keep them handy. Thank you."
@jeremiahpeters_ @TransLink Holy shit. I complain to TransLink too about certain drivers no response.  People that far gone shouldn't be let on. The buses are getting smelly too. I am sorry you have to see that. I hope you get your license soon
"Wish that @TransLink would send out alerts when a bus is going to be cancelled.  Two and half hours to get home last night.  Leave work at 5, home by 7:30."
Super excited!
"@stephenlautens Wow. With @TransLink's Compass card you can manage multiple cards on one account, set up auto reloads for both monthly passes and pay as you go. It's great."
"@translink why is the 228 Lonsdale quay bus always so dam late, smhh"
@TransLink does text to 33333 not work any more?
@TransLink 51749
@TransLink Aha. I was texting to 33333* - what it says on the sign. Confusing that...
@TransLink are the Port Moody Westcoast express tap terminals working now?  There were 3 terminals that were broken this morning.  Will be a mess getting off the train after work if they're still not working.
@TransLink the driver of 10 Granville currently on Robson needs a raise - one of the nicest bus drivers I’ve ever ridden with! ??
"@TransLink the driver of 10 Granville on Nelson at this very moment needs a raise - one of the nicest bus drivers I’ve ever ridden with!
Wish I knew his name but hopefully you can track him down and give him some kudos ??"
@TransLink is the 320 (stop 55235) scheduled at 3:51pm cancelled? app says next departure is at 3:03?
"@j_holtslander @TransLink So it’s like filling up a tank of gas, but authorizing $100 and only needing $65"
@TransLink i’m aware you don’t have an app. i’m using the app a good majority of metro vancouver uses which i’m sure you’re not blind to: Transit. thanks!
@TransLink Thanks also that small panel display is on one end of the platform maybe for now put up a small screen on the waterfront mall side of the platform as well that will tell us which 3 lines are coming next just like on the opposite end of the platform.
Even the TTC hates its riders less than @TransLink does.
@TransLink Someone vomited on the west end of the EB platform at Columbia Skytrain station FYI.
"@TransLink could you please tell me why the 183 from Moody Centre at 16:20 has been late for at least 3 days in a row? Today they are moving from Coquitlam in a ""flock"" this one chased by the next schedule. What's going on??"
"@TransLink Driver side stop cord broken on S18206, on it's second day of service too haha"
"Just walked up Granville Street, @translink must have the noisiest electric trolley busses in the world."
@TransLink No problem
@TransLink why did an almost completely empty 160 just pass a busy bus stop of people waiting for it??? Is this how buses work now they skip their stops randomly???
"@TransLink Yes, I understand that it was late from the previous trip. My question is why?? It has been the case for the three consecutive days. And the one following it is all fine and on time. I am on the bus already. I don't need help. Just asking TL to investigate."

@bjcjapan @TransLink I've gotten word that the City is working with Translink to ensure enhanced bike parking (short and long term) is considered as well as recognizing that a bike share system will mean more space willbe need for those bikes as well. No final designs/layouts have been shared!
"@jessicamcilroy @TransLink I’m very happy to hear this! I know the City is committed to sustainable transportation options. Thank you so much for the follow up!
@tonyvalente_ca"
@TransLink what’s going on with 555? This is the longest line I have ever had.
@jessicamcilroy @bjcjapan @TransLink Great news. Hopefully the bike parking will be usable and not those shells like at City Hall that don’t work with all bikes.
Caught a @TransLink public art bus today! And as an added benefit it came with a friendly driver announcing every stop ? ? #howfardoyoutravel. Great service folks! Thank you ??
@TransLink I think an 84 was supposed to pick people up at VCC Clark station at 6:14. None showed up despite one or two buses being parked there. Any news on the next one?

"@jodyvance @BowinnMa @TransLink To go where? 

There is no capacity at either end (Lower Lonsdale or Downtown) to move vehicles efficiently to anywhere. 

JMHO"
@TransLink No but I will switch. Thanks for confirming. Out of curiosity what time does it switch to one of each? I take the train this time twice every week and usually after 7 it’s gone back to 1:1. I haven’t experienced 2:1 at this time of the evening in ...I don’t even know how long.

Omg every @TransLink West coast express train needs a @PADSdogs on it. Also Sprout is such a good boy! 
@TransLink Especially when it's only in the fine print and there's no energy put towards increased education! I'd really like to have one transit rode a week without having an allergic reaction to this crap.
@TransLink I'm also confused why @TransLink paid money for these announcements (I'm assuming Seth Rogan doesn't work for free) but now isn't using them?
@translink train 044 west bound we have a rider passed out across 5 seats
@TransLink The 480 I was on and the 41s behind it could take elm up to 49th.  The articulated 43 would not likely fit.
@TransLink looks like millennium line car 219 has vomit ? which would explain why it isn't as packed as usual...?
@TransLink its ok he's up now so no need.  Thanks!

@nicksair @USSoccerRef @trimet @kcmetrobus @sdmts @BayAreaClipper @cta @TransLink @MARTASERVICE Ah! That’s the only major west coast city I don’t have one for. Got Clipper and LA’s card.  :)
@TransLink you should do these things too lol
"Important point. Also interesting to note: One of the impressive cities for transit ridership growth in North America, Vancouver, does not have Uber. (Canada wasn't in the study.) @TransLink has been killing it but no ridehailing poaching has to help, too."

"@TransLink Thanks for the response. I hope it's sooner rather than later. I hate being so squashed that I can scarcely glance at my phone, never mind get a big old paperback out. And I think only people getting on at Coquitlam are allowed actual seats."
"@GandyHVAC hi am employee driving your vehicles in the Walnut Grove location (88th and 202st) the driver was reckless and cut dangerously in front of a @TransLink bus. What an asshat. Employee was about 5'7"" beard and smells of cheap Aqua Velva. He went into the taco place."
@TransLink Please please. As a teacher in an inner city school who uses the world as her classroom this would save thousands of dollars and heighten the educational experience 10x while helping us support community. busses are expensive and grants cannot be used for transport

@TransLink Remove this driver from this route. I don't do feedback cs nothing happen even if I do.
"@TransLink But if they're opening the door constantly and it's cold... Shouldn't they then at least wear pants? It would make sense to be dressed warmer. Last time I asked I got sneered at. Humans aren't always accommodating. I get you, but its not indicative to the reality."
@TransLink I know you're a social media person trying to do your job. It doesn't change the fact that it's -10 out right now and the drivers are wearing shorts and short sleeves. It shouldn't be expected for passengers to strip to be comfortable. Pass memo to applicable department thx

@TransLink I saw someone changing the timetable at Moody st. What's the change?
"@TransLink @Eric_Doherty @electricyvr Thanks, they've been added since I first looked! Presumably you have had to dieselise 14/16/20 or can the trolleybuses detour on batteries?"

@TransLink @Eric_Doherty @electricyvr Thanks. I'll have to look it up on my map.
"@TransLink @middxguy @Eric_Doherty Looks like the 210 needs an alert for this. The 209 is mentioned under the 4, but the 210 is still running."
@TransLink ... the no. 160 bus is broken down at the intersection of falcon drive and guildford Ave wb on guildford in port moody.
@TransLink Oh... I apologise I am not on the bus itself but drove passed in my vehicle. I thought I would let you know.
@TransLink @middxguy @Eric_Doherty The normal route in the area is the same for the 4//7 and 209/210. Worth confirming the detour is too. The new Alerts system certainly is an improvement!

"@electricyvr @TransLink “The STM is also considering installing doors on the platforms of busy stations to help prevent personal items from falling on the tracks, causing further congestion in the public transit network.” More importantly, this would also help stop people from falling on the tracks."

@TransLink south van frosty and foggy any problems with the trolleys?
@TransLink waited for 99 ubc b line at broadway and clarke at 5:50am driver did not open the back door tried to go to the front door driver closes the door and left what a service !!!!
"@TransLink Oh no, how will passengers survive!"
"@TransLink it did come actually, it just wasn’t showing on the map. Thanks!"
@TransLink I just realized...the transit bus pass doesn't expire a month from your current day of your purchase but at the end of the month...is there anything I can do? As of this point? Paying $95 for a total of less than $50 is...sigh

"Good morning @TransLink I’m on a 100 bus just west of Jellicoe and the bus is FULL! We must be leaving folks behind. The 1 min increase in bus frequency is a good start, but real need is for bigger buses and a B-line please. Thx for reading."
@TransLink second narrows entry  is a parking lot. Why is 28 not detouring?
@TransLink you as well!

@TransLink when will buses unload at Joyce Station? Even now there are huge berths that the bus could unload at but instead we have to walk across the street with overcrowded crosswalks on unfinished sidewalks.
"@TransLink I lost a red and white crock pot on a Millennium line train headed east that was at Lougheed about 7:35. I'll report it to lost and found shortly, but I was just wondering if it had been seen first?"
"@TransLink Stop#51525 , happened at 8:01am, next 25 Brentwood came at 8:12am"
@TransLink one suggestion for the Canada Line: trains northbound arriving at VCC should stay open for another 10-15 seconds. I often see the doors closing on the last people getting out or on the people coming in where they then force the door open.

@TransLink I was just using that as an example. Do the 8:45am busses usually have issues? This has happened on more than 5 occasions for this specific time.
@TransLink Both

"@jake_bergen @TransLink Yeah. When the bus is packed it gets plenty warm itself; and it's always packed.

"@TransLink hey this bus driver needs to be retrained: he drove right by my stop (prince edward st) even tho im the only person waiting, no “bus full” sign on, there’s clearly standing room &amp; he stopped at the nxt stop (main st). if i knew he wuldnt stop, i wuldve walked to main"
"7/ @TransLink has already undertaken a study around free transit for kids. The fare hole for Metro Van is about $30M, on annual fares of $550M, IIRC. It's not nothing, but $30M annually is hardly an insurmountable ask of our municipal and provincial governments."
@the1travisb @TransLink Travis they are asking for feedback. Do you have any recommendations from your experience in Tokyo?
"If you ride #SkyTrain, provide @TransLink your feedback on how the next 200 cars can be made better. "
"@the1travisb @TransLink Another recommendation is more foldable seats (meant to be used by seniors, those with disability, or pregnant women) so when not in use they can fold to create more standing room."
"@van_city632 @TransLink I have a laundry list, never mind the dependability of their systems. One would be controlled orderly boarding at sky train stations."
@tlupick @AdaptPharma @TransLink 1/2: What's not explained here is the monopoly Adapt Pharma Canada has over the market and the insanely high cost of this medication. Adapt's high drug prices and the public health barriers for wide distribution of intranasal naloxone should be the focus of  this article.
"@tlupick @AdaptPharma @TransLink 2/2: Their 2-day visit is a stunt to increase public pressure for an already strained public health system to distribute intranasal naloxone more widely. If they want wider distribution, why don't they lower their cost? It's entirely messed up how pharma profits from this crisis."
"@alissa_greer @AdaptPharma @TransLink ""Buxton said the difference is partly because the formulation of naloxone adopted by BC is generic, whereas Adapt Pharma's remains proprietary..."" And in response to your second tweet, note the article's second graph bluntly states the whole visit is a stunt. But fair criticism."
"A woman on my bus just got told she can't get off at Vanness stop because the city of Burnaby won't make it wheelchair accessible so if something happens, the bus driver is liable. Um... wat?

@ch0c0tam @RideShareBC @yvrairport @TransLink @Uber @lyft @CityofVancouver Might be worth a try to checkout @RydeToday since taking taxi for long distance might be also equivalent to luxury sedan service. And way better service and experience. And the app works
Let @TransLink know about seats and flex space. ??
@TransLink honestly your drivers should tell the people to go to the back to cater more commuters. There's still space at the back but the driver didn't stop because they were all at the front!!! 
@TransLink Yeah I got on. I'm just a little stressed from an all nighter q.q Just a little jittery about being late for class. Thanks anyways :p
@TransLink But it happens almost all the time. At this same time. Because the adult school at 88ave have atleast 10-15 students taking the bus. So if you're not in control that will happen all the time except for weekends or holidays or semester breaks. Thanks
@TransLink Build the dang broadway line already what are u waiting for?
@TransLink I will. See this next bus deosn't move until everyone goes to the back to take more passengers. Unfortunately he still needs to skip 4 or 5 more stops because the first one didn't do it. It's a domino effect. People outside are yelling at him. He did his best.

@NVanDistrict @AM730Traffic @TransLink I don’t often take transit unless we’re having an intoxicated night out. A B-Line is a good idea but it doesn’t need to stop at the Quay! That totally defeats it. Upgrade the stop at 3rd and Lonsdale and people can get on and off there.

WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME @TransLink HAS POCKET SQUARES 
"@604Now For people like me who have allergies to perfumes/colognes, a 10 minute @TransLink ride becomes a whole day of dealing with allergies. 

Honesty, when are we going to make it a scent free zone?"
People who wear cologne/perfume on @TransLink are a scourge to anyone with allergies/asthma
For future reference anyone who may ever want to/need to buy me a gift: this store has everything you could want
"@TransLink I did send info to your customer service:(Samujh, Shannonand) then asked if some action was taken and got a ""cannot discuss due to privacy laws)..I'm not asking for his SIN or address or name - I simply want to be assured he has been spoken to"

"A mom in White Rock left a @TransLink bus in tears this week, after she says a bus driver berated her over the size of her twin stroller. Melanie Beacon says driver told her off about her 'oversize' stroller, and even said 'it's women like you who make my job difficult' @NEWS1130 "
"Beacon says this is a women's rights issue, saying a lot of parents rely on public transit and should be welcomed, not yelled at. Meantime @TransLink has confirmed it's recieved a complaint about the incident, and the investigation is ongoing. @NEWS1130"
@TransLink I took the advice and filled out a report of EXACTLY what happened on the link provided....I would think you would like to know if your drivers are not doing their job properly
"@TransLink I didn't describe driver as I ran out of words,,but you must be able to trace who had the route that everning and  know who he is?...28-30...slim, dark hair possibly Islamic or East Indian.sorry...best I can do..too upset to note much more"
"Good news, indeed. I encouraged @translink to consider vertical bike racks used in Portland’s @trimet MAX light rail. They allow you to securely hang your bike. Don’t need to hold your bike in place for the entire trip, which I find frustrating for cyclists who use Skytrain."
"@TransLink Question: What does ""layover only"" mean? The Night Bus is my ride to work today, and the sign at the first stop says ""Layover only."" Are passengers allowed to board there?"
@TransLink Yep. The bus took too wide a turn onto Cambie and skipped the stop.
@Raegrr @604Now @TransLink I wouldn't know any approach other than appealing to peoples humanity. Would they think wearing perfume was worth the health of others if they knew how much it affected people with allergies?
@TransLink Mmm no I’m sure you’re able to pass that along.
"@Raegrr @604Now @TransLink I wouldn't know any approach other than appealing to peoples humanity. Would they think twice about wearing scents if they knew how much it affected the health of others?

@TransLink  I attended a talk at SFU on the 24th; Kevin Desmond introduced the main speaker and showed a short TransLink video that explored the future challenges for public transit. It was REALLY good - where can I find it online?
@Tarankparmar @NEWS1130 @TransLink Let's see the size of the stroller. Some people are pushing around some outrageously large strollers these days.
"@Tarankparmar @TransLink @NEWS1130 I want to be sympathetic but.. how is it a women’s right issue to not be “welcomed”? She was allowed to ride the bus. Should the driver be censured? Of course, for being rude, but this reaction is over the top"
Sorry..  your double wide stroller on a bus sucks and nobody likes you if you bring one on transit.
"@Tarankparmar @NEWS1130 @TransLink How big was it? Regulations state twin strollers need to be single file, collapsible, and no bigger than 4ftx2ft. There are safety considerations &amp; size issues around getting things on and off the bus. Sucks, but until we get better design on the system it's what we have."
"@Tarankparmar @TransLink @NEWS1130 It's dumb women like this who cause people who are actually fighting for women's rights great difficulty. This isn't a women's rights issue, it's an issue with an entitled brat who has no consideration for anyone around her. She needs to grow up &amp; understand what real issues are."

"@Tarankparmar @NEWS1130 @TransLink Dads push strollers  too! Just curious, what would people say if this was a large wheel chair?"

@Tarankparmar @NEWS1130 @TransLink Strollers on transit should be banned.  Everyone eyerolls when some gets on with one and that's a well known fact.  Maybe they can put a stroller holder at the front of the bus with the bike racks
"@Tarankparmar @NEWS1130 @TransLink It’s not a woman’s rights issue. It maybe be a rights issue,but anyone can push a stroller. If it was a guy pushing one,I have no doubt,he would of been chastised too."
"@BenSimons28 @Tarankparmar @NEWS1130 @TransLink That the guy was a whiner, probably"
@TransLink Thank you for your assistance!
In the not too distant past strollers got folded up before being brought on the bus. Strollers are now the size humvees. Quit whining.
@Tarankparmar @TransLink @NEWS1130 If the stroller is bigger than a wheelchair she should find some other means of transportation.
"Interesting how no one complains when seniors and mobility challenged people are told by bus drivers to move from the 'courtesy seats' so those same strollers can take up the front of the bus, forcing those ppl to stand"

They just don't fit over a certain size :/  apparently they are supposed to kick the strollers off for wheelchairs too. Having collapsible could make the difference getting home.

32 min: Production to Commercial
21 min: Production to Lafarge so it's 9 minutes slower by transferring at Production"
@FEEZYDoesIT @strategyrick @TransLink Not on any metrics are cars most efficient - not even for inter-city travel.
"@martynschmoll @strategyrick @TransLink Then why do the majority of people chose to use the car. Efficiency on time and moving on their schedule rather than fixed one. Privacy, security, speed, all make it the best solution available."
@FEEZYDoesIT @strategyrick @TransLink We’ve been over this. But it’s not because cars are efficient. Saying it over and over won’t make it so.
"@martynschmoll @strategyrick @TransLink But... They are. The observable reality, the experience of every day people on our roads says so. The vast majority make this choice everyday. Today we have more people here and they too want to make that choice and have the right to do so."

@TransLink @TransLink who do I speak to because this has happened too many times to too many people.

Is something up with #SkyTrain @TransLink ? There's been 4 eastbound trains at Nanaimo but no westbound ones
@TransLink almost 7 minutes waiting for skytrain ar Nanaimo st to waterfront! Whats going on?
@TransLink Seems like there is a problem everyday lately. On another train right now that is being held outside stations for longer than usually due to a train problem at a different station. It’s getting very frustrating

.@TransLink whats up with expo line to dt?
@TransLink The #5/6 service every morning up Davie a total joke. 2 buses back to back. Front bus picks up no one. We're crammed on 2nd bus!
@TransLink I'm actually quite enjoying your decapitated snowman safety campaign. Those guys lose their heads over anything.
@TransLink - I don’t want to hear any fees raised this year. Only 3 people were able to get a train on this platform because of a busted door on one of the train cars. Yet it appears that you don’t seem to know this.
@TransLink @ladynathybug Isn’t that worrisome? Something as simple as a held door can delay Ima major city’s entire rapid transit system?

@TransLink just letting you know bad traffic is stopping 95B lines travelling west (to Burrard)  from getting past Boundary - might want to put an alert out?
@TransLink there IS a problem. Your staff put up a sign on that skytrain door. Stop blaming the public that it’s us holding the door that’s causing the delay.
@TransLink It consistently happens for the 145. And today there were 2 small buses on a row. Why are you constantly out of long buses?
@CKNW @AM730Traffic @abbotsford Instead of adding more space for cars look at providing rail service. Use a European model to connect the communities in the Fraser valley to metro Vancouver. @bcndp @jjhorgan @TransLink give people the ability to get out of their cars.
@TransLink that's cool. Close the doors before people who got off so others could get off can get on.
@TransLink what the hell is happening on the skytrain this morning??
@TransLink @patrickallain @ladynathybug There’s a busted door on one of the trains and it’s empty. It’s not us. It’s totally Translink’s fault.

"@TransLink at stop 50073 for 25 minutes. #2 keeps going past, full. And 44 keeps going past empty. Obviously this was a great decision. "
@TransLink hey I've had 5 busses in a row drive by because they're full(23 west bound). Been waiting here for over half an hour! Please add more buses
@TransLink Is there only one bus operating Route 412 this morning? The 0855 hasn’t arrived/departed from Bridgeport yet and no where in sight on the map view
"@TransLink I average a 4 bus wait on a good day, @TransLink. 6 if you count the equally as packed 9s. This is not acceptable for 5 more years as the train is built."

@TransLink If it’s not one thing it’s another... thanks guys for the msg.
"@TransLink There are 20 people at Main right now, the last 99 only fit 2 people on, and the one before didn’t bother to even stop and let its 4 passengers off at Ontario. That’s 4 spaces that could have eased this huge backup."

.@TransLink Hey are we gonna get the 9:20 143 from Burquitlam? Usually a bus laying over here ready to take us up but we do not have one today. Seeming like a no-show to me.
@TransLink I’m not gonna waste my time formally writing a response that none of your staff do anything about. This is a constant problem and you know it. You don’t need to investigate. Fix it.
@TransLink Can we get a regular driver for this route because this is ridiculous. Hard to have consistency when there's a new driver every day
@kenboo_35 @TransLink Bro just run to work you’re not even in that far from it
"@TransLink At Burquitlam, the 9:19 143 is VERY late. And driver showed up at 9:23 and is taking a break, what gives?"
@TransLink Yes and the driver chose to do a break. So it's going to depart 8 mins behind making over 100 people late to class ?
@TransLink quite the crowd at stop #51701 waiting for 27 since 8:45 - any updates or alerts?
@TransLink Yes one came a minute after that tweet. Thank you!

@TransLink Has anybody seen the 95 B line? Any updates appreciated.
@TransLink @amonkeyfishfrog But shouldn’t they know the route?
@TransLink i get theres traffic on the iron workers bridge right now but the 28 to phibbs completely just drove past the kootenay loop stop?? i thought it was designated to stop here when theres traffic since the next stop isnt open then
@TransLink Thank you. It finally came.
@TransLink there hasn’t been a single 95 B-Line at Burrard in 45 minutes 
@TransLink delays for 16 bound for 29 Ave stn? I think we've missed two buses so far
"@TransLink @BCTransit I figured that. Whats more annoying though, is I’ll catch the 9 or whatever gets me to Granville street. Only to see the 14 sitting at fir and broadway for 3 mins because it’s too early. Frustrating!"
@TransLink Eastbound on 95B. Major delays between McDonald and Kootenay. Clear sailing after that.
@TransLink stuck waiting at Kincaid and smith. Three 28 buses and two 129 buses haven’t shown. Is there a detour or something happening?

@TransLink Thanks for the quick response
@Dune_Emperor @BurnabyRCMP @TransitPolice @icbc @TransLink Distracted drivers kill around 88 people per year in BC. Irresponsible to suggest that police don’t crackdown on that.
@wrychrd @BurnabyRCMP @TransitPolice @icbc @TransLink So pull the transit police off the transit system &amp; off translink budget and put them into the municipal police departments. Stop wasting transit dollars on municipal policing

@Dune_Emperor @BurnabyRCMP @TransitPolice @icbc @TransLink Isn’t stopping theft a municipal police responsibility?
@wrychrd @BurnabyRCMP @TransitPolice @icbc @TransLink I agree. Disband @TransitPolice &amp; just use municipal police &amp; use the dollars for more busses

@TransLink No I missed it. So there'll be another bus here in 15 minutes?
Hi @TransLink @selinarobinson @BowinnMa Need to make sure there is more than one elevator per platform in new and upgraded transit stations. Better safer more convenient access plus backup in case of breakdown.
"@TransLink It's 2:00, where is the bus?"
@TransLink are the 99 and 84 busses running?
@TransLink 1/2 hour wait for a bus in below freezing temperatures. ?
@TransLink Hello! Can you tell us when the Compass wristbands will be available for those who missed last year's release?
got B-eef? let your voice B heard. stand up for what you B-elieve in ?
"Exciting news! @TransLink is hosting the opening of the #CommercialBroadway #bike parkade this Mon. 3-6pm at 10th St entrance. Visit the HUB Tent, get your bike registered for free with @Project529BC. First 30 people to check out the new bike parkade get a #bicycle repair kit!"
"@TransLink Hi! Not sure if driver has to report, thought I’d FYI — #2251, route 9 at ~ st george&amp;broadway 2:30pm— when it pulled out of the stop the white truck beside/behind had to brake so fast that he was rear ended. I heard but didn’t see. Cheers!"
@TransLink Getting home tonight could be interesting
"@wrychrd @TransLink @selinarobinson @BowinnMa How about bike rails on the staircases too, less demand on the elevators than for those who need them."
@TransLink  : at Burrard I just watched someone take a ticket out of the garage infront of your customer care people and tap out to go on the train &amp; your #CS person did nothing. #BullShit
"@TransLink No thanks , that doesn't help , I even asked Your rep what they're gonna do , she just walked away. #GoodJob"
@TransLink is 151 bus not getting any delays today? Thanks!
@TransLink Gatensburg and como lake ave
"@TransLink when do the bracelets become available, please
   thank you"
@TransLink thank you
@TransLink It's ok now. All good. Thanks for the reply.
@TransLink I forgot my head at Bus number 7. It was yellow. At 3rd feb and ?t was about 1 pm...
@JanetBrown980 @TransitPolice @SurreyRCMP @CKNW @GlobalBC @steeletalk @jarmstrongbc @TransLink Great news.
@TransLink Does the Canada Line have this too?
@TransLink Thank you?. I cant call but I can fill the form.
"@TransLink Sup, just curious, what's the minimum age of kids to ride transit alone?"
"@TransLink Ok, thanks Steven Pattler."
"@TransLink Yeah, it was taken on an iPhone, Dicke Adams."
@TransLink Thank you Translink for keeping everyone moving!  The tech behind Skytrain has always fascinated me.  Might an engineer be available at some point to converse with me on the in's and it's the Skytrains marvellous tech?  If not I understand.  Thankful always.
@TransLink alright SP.
"@TransLink Sure thing.  Thank you for replying and keep up all the good work you do.  I know customer service isn't easy, I've done it.  Do tell the Skytrain ppl, especially the control centre I know their jobs are hard but I bet it's fun at times.  :) I mean remote control Trains, lol."
"@TransLink Thank you I’m well aware as I’m a driver , this has been a huge conversation piece in our group we REALLY appreciate your support here ."
@BCFerries Is there no way to coordinate with @TransLink on this kind of thing? This is the third time in 3 weeks this has happened.
"@TransLink why are occasional passengers, who do not start their commute near #skytrain stations, forced to pay DOUBLE! fare?! #translink #lowermainland "
@TransLink good evening. A 430 was supposed to arrive at 51309 at 6:37 but it didn't. Is there anything going on with it?
"@InstantJake I can understand your frustration with having to wait, but we aren't able to delay our departures when the bus is running behind. Please know I will share your feedback with management and I suggest you reach out to @TransLink about their scheduling. ^as"
"

The next station is: Commercial-Broadway. @TransLink @LaureenRegan"
Thanks for share @MetroElfren
"@TransLink, why is there an ad for an ad for an anti-abortion organization that is actively spreading misinformation at Lougheed Station?"
"@Jon_Lloyd_B @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink The problem is transit is needed in the highest density places. By definition it's going to be expensive. That's why I was interested in building to address pinch points first. If the city is afraid of the cost, in my view, the best place to start is there."
"@Jon_Lloyd_B @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink Additionally, they thought there wasn't room because they believed growth in south Winnipeg would increase traffic. The whole reason to build BRT should have been because of those people. Pembina was written off with the exact reason the corridor should have been on Pembina."
@TransLink the crackheads who come on the train are just vile cockroaches
"@JosephKornelsen @Jon_Lloyd_B @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink Yes! That's what seems to be lacking from the entire discussion (not this one on Twitter, but the bigger picture in Wpg). Good transit is by its very nature suppose to reduce traffic &amp; maximize mobility. Seems it's being treated as a ""well, if we can accommodate it"" nice-to-have."
@JosephKornelsen @Jon_Lloyd_B @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink This sounds like the most Winnipeg reasoning I can think of.
"@emmaewood @JosephKornelsen @Jon_Lloyd_B @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink ""Transit if we can accommodate it"", ""bike lanes over my dead body"", ""you'll have to pry the keys to my SUV out of my cold, dead hands"", and so on."
"@JosephKornelsen @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink I'm not sure I completely agree with that. If you look at where the majority of people live along that corridor it's not on Pembina. It's in Lindenwoods, Whyte Ridge, Ft. Richmond, St. Norbert, etc. So a super expensive RT line on Pembina still doesn't service those users."
@team_yellowstar @TransLink @SkyTrain4Surrey @pixelart2051 @ybabic72 what should the next SkyTrain Line be?
"@JosephKornelsen @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink Building as was done for SW corridor allows you to serve those users, allowed for new growth in Ft Rouge Yards, and opens up opportunities to create new connections to Charleswoods and that surrounding area."
@Austin39140404
"@JosephKornelsen @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink And bluntly, do you see the prov &amp; feds providing 3-4 times as much money as they spent on the SW BRT to create this route on Pembina that you feel is required? I don't. You can say we should do ""x"" all you want but money talks &amp; Wpg isn't going to see that kind of gov investment"
"@JosephKornelsen @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink Let's also remember where we were politically when the functional design was done. It wasn't done last year, or the year before. The design was done many years ago. In 2018 we held a public vote over being allowed to cross Portage/Main as a pedestrian. We still have work to do"
"@Jon_Lloyd_B @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink It's as much about the destinations as it is about the people. There's stuff to get to on Pembina. With the loss of Price Chopper and the Bay grocery store, there will only be one full grocery store along the entire corridor at the south end when the second phase opens."
"@Jon_Lloyd_B @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink Well, we obviously won't see eye to eye about the corridor but I certainly agree that there is work to be done. I'm optimistic about Winnipeg Transit."
Hey @TransLink we should make it a standard that if the buss is waiting they let your freezing over paying customers on to wait too... just saying
@TransLink mark i car 082 is screeching when it comes to a stop at stations

"@TransLink So same driver, same driving today. Speeding to beat a red light and ending up past the white line while slamming brakes. I get that I didn't DM but these are real traffic violations regardless of how it's reported."
@TransLink any delays or issues with the 8 Fraser/Downtown bus this morning?
@TransLink Great.  Thanks!
hi @TransLink can you please remove the Jan. 14 alert for the 791 bus departing at 6:00 am
"Marpole 100 has temporarily moved to bay 3! (@ Bus Stop 52183 (100) - @translink in New Westminster, BC) "

@TransLink Thx. Stay warm.
@TransLink Any issues with #16 bus eastbound?
@TransLink is Handy dart running as normal?
@TransLink Thank you
@TransLink any issues with the 145 heading up to SFU ?
@TransLink Which two. My stop is 51089. When is the next bus please?
@TransLink 51089. When are the next two buses please? In cold temps there are usually issues with this route (trolley wires).
@TransLink is the 105 bus delayed? I am at stop# 52491
@TransLink And then the next times in the next 15 minutes?
@TransLink waiting at bus stop 54910 since 705am  the 391 n 319 bus no show great service

@TransLink it's a chilly on the train this morning. Was the heat even on on car #252 on the Millennium line? #brrrrr
@SFU If only we had a gondola... @TransLink
@TransLink Are there any delays for #25 running eastbound (from ubc to Brentwood)?
@TransLink is the 157 coming by to stop 53607
@JosephKornelsen @emmaewood @DwtnWpgRises @wpgeye @winnipegtransit @TransLink That’s fair. We’re also 15 plus yrs on from the beginning of the SW planning. Things will likely look a lot different for the eastern corridor. I suspect no two corridors in Wpg will look alike. But good to be discussing building RT &amp; not calling it a waste. Progress!
@TransLink where is the 210 bus comint down to kirkstone and mountain hwy! Been waitint for 30 mins..!!#translink #bc #vancouver #commuterlife 
@TransLink is the 371 at 55152 on time? I don’t see it on the map?
@TransLink I am standing at bus stop number 58549 waiting to catch the 531 to Willowbrook. Your website said it was supposed to come at 7:43 a.m. this morning. Still no sign. Is something up? Or is it just running late?
"Reason #729 to love @TransLink 

It's below zero here for the first weekday this season, and the bus is nearly twenty fucking minutes late

#thankstranslink

Route 640 from Scott road

Oh here it is, twenty minutes late, on the dot"
@TransLink ridiculous over 20 people waiting for 555 at 156 st but the past two buses were already when they passed
@TransLink do you anticipate the #canadaline not working today from Richmond — Waterfront due to weather conditions?
"@TransLink Okay, thanks for letting me know."
I am Love’n ?? this new Skytrain platform and fancy new trains @TransLink very smooth commute this morning. Those ? are still causing trouble though.
@TransLink 2 bussed passed by indicating they are full but it looked half full.. please if the snow will affect transit be more effective please
@TransLink Good morning! I received a couple of cancellation notices this morning for the 145 Production Way going up to SFU. Are most of the buses making it up the hill?
@TransLink Good to know. I will do that. Thanks!
@TransLink hi just wanted to double check if the 153 to coquitlam station is running. The real time says they are but the Alerts say that they have been cancelled
@TransLink hi!! Is the 123 in New West stopped for the day?? And is the 106 in New West running? Pls let me know :)
@TransLink I found a lost wallet on the train - where are your Canada Line attendants stationed today so I can turn it in?
@TransLink hey what's up with the 123 to new west station? One just came by but it was so full no one could get on. I'm at stop 51419
@TransLink why are all of the 155 buses cancelled in New West? Thanks.

Hey @translink did the 257 bus  departing Horseshoe Bay at 9:40 get cancelled?
"@TransLink sunny Monday, wee bit of snow and cool. WHY keep trains 11m apart on cdn line for dt? curious  very curious"
"@TransLink if I don't have a mthly pass and get on train at scott road, off at stadium, back on at Stadium in 15 minutes, and off at waterfront...  do I pay for 3 zones and then 1 more zone if its all within 1 hr 30 minutes?"
"@TransLink Alright, a little flexibility with other busses would be nice. The 9:25 could have left 5 minutes late and prevented 40 people from waiting out in the cold for half an hour."
@TransLink the next southbound Canada line to YVR says it’s arriving in 8 minutes. Wondering why there is a delay.
The new Commercial Broadway station is BEAUTIFUL! @TransLink
"Alright @TransLink, I’m tired of missing the 257 bus by 2 minutes every time I take the 8:40 @BCFerries from #langdale. Here’s what bus times people on the #sunshinecoastbc need. "

@TransLink Ok thanks
@electricyvr @TransLink First time using platform 5 last night. Great to see all the space. Caught one of the new more roomy trains too. Felt like a good glimpse of the future where many more folks will be using transit!

"@gimmedatbrain @city_plannerd @TTChelps @JohnTory @JayeRobinson @gordperks @TransLink On my list, haven't been yet! It's amazing how much the TTC does with what little it gets.

"@TransLink protip... When a stop has changed, cover up the old signage #massconfusion"

"@TransLink I notice that stop 59044 on Tower Road (up by SFU) is closed as of today, might want to mention that. The signage at the stop is rather subtle, and I wasn’t the only person waiting for a bus that didn’t come this AM."

@TransLink How long is this Happening for
"@EliseRoy is our keynote speaker at Innovation Week's ""Transportation Forum"" now open for regn:  sponsored by @TransLink #bctech #intelligentnw "
@Amilyntay @TransLink Thanks Amilyntay. I don't get why this hasn't already been made a bigger deal than this. This driver makes me SO uncomfortable. Constantly speeding and slamming on breaks at every intersection. Guess I'll call in cause Translink gets away with murder even when reported.
@TransLink Don't understand how you can just drop service levels  and be ok with that.
@TransLink #CanadaLine train #220 R3 Spill in the accessible area. Clean up required. 
@TransLink Still an insane amount of pigeons and crap from them... won't be using the new platform at all.
@TransLink the 3:28 601 bus at 59478 never showed up
@jescobar_van @TransLink If you can report the incidents please do.  The reporting process is somewhat onerous and ridiculous and long.  Your tweet had all the general info they need to take action and yet they act like there isn’t anything they possibly can do with out report that will have same info ????

@TransLink hi has the 22 downtown resumed its normal route?
@TransLink Bus drivers have been extra friendly lately! #vantransit

"@george_affleck @TransLink Assuming 60sec headway, the theoretical capacity is 12 passengers x 60 trips/hr = 720 PPHPD.

That is nice, but not a substitute for rail has an order of magnitude or more capacity"
@TransLink today I found out that my daughters bike was stolen from the Main Street Science World bike parkade and that the so called “locked door” had been broken for 2 weeks and if I do not get a compensation from you for the stolen bike I will go to the media and tell them
"@translink what happened, I’m sure you do not want bad publicity. This was her means of earning a living and now the bike gone is which means my daughter won’t be able to work anymore. This should not have happened in the first place, why do you have these places to lock up bikes"
@translink if they are not properly secured or maintained by security. Now we are out of an $1000 bicycle and an expensive lock
@TransLink We’ve already done that
"@TransLink if I start at 11:45am tomorrow, wanting to go from Production to Joyce Stn, is taking Millennium Line to Broadway and switching to Expo Line (EB) faster or the direct non-transfer Expo Line Production to Joyce faster? Thanks!"
@TransLink I really don’t care about your 15 days . If I don’t get my bike replaced or money to buy a new one . I’m going to the media ??????
@Scott_dLB @TransLink No. Not a replacement for underground that’s for sure. But why not be a test city. We have the perfect routes in place.
@TransLink Thanks :D also getting a seat using the direct route is a bonus:)
@TransLink you guys should’ve named it platform 9 &amp; 3/4
@TransLink @TransitPolice is it ok to consume Palm Bay Vodka Soda onnthe train and crashing into other passengers cuz you’re drunk? 
@TransLink @TransitPolice it definitely was a Palm Bay Vodka Soda because she tried to conceal the name of the can with her hand but she was so tipsy that she revealed it a few times.
@TransitPolice @TransLink checked in wth the attendant at Royal Oak because I had to get off but she was on train #314 headed towards east. Should be around New West Station now if she hasn’t gotten off
"@TransLink  bus stop 52248 is covered in ice, I guess you guys want someone to slip and fall?"
@HRPSbikecop @TransLink @TransitPolice I love it
@TransLink @TransitPolice That’s no problem. I was talking to the skytrain attendant by Royal Oak so wasn’t able to immediately submit the additional info. I wanted to check in and make sure public drinking is NOT ok even tho she wasn’t being a loud drunk.

"@TransLink so every Monday at 9:45pm your going to do maintenance and screw up everyone's way home? This stupid city has no other options to leave because @jjhorgan won't give the city proper ride sharing. And you do Skytrain maintenance at this time? Ridiculous city, hate it."

@TransLink I'm at King George station. I've noticed that the trains are pulling into the westbound platform immediately after the previous train leaves. I like that because I don't have to freeze while waiting on the platform. Thanks
"@TransLink Yah well, write that on your wall or door. And dont make a innocent person worry"

@Amilyntay @TransLink And tbh not sure that the lawyers and insurance will agree that these are not enough for you to do the right thing.

@TransLink I have a question. Which Formula 1 circuit was the driver of the 99 B-line to UBC at 5:44am a part of?  #speedovercomfort #whiplash.
@TransLink Thank you!

@TransLink your number 2 bus keeps being late at stop 50072. You’re leaving your customers waiting in the freezing -6c when roads a perfectly dry. If the bus won’t be here when you say it will then remove it from the schedule and allow people to plan properly

.@TransLink How should I report a lazy goofy driver of yours confidentially?

@TransLink It’s late coming into Pitt Meadows
"@TransLink hey uh, I've been noticing that the credit/debit card readers on the compass machines are getting more and more finicky.  Only 1 in 4 would read my debit card this morning (and it's a pretty new card)."

@TransLink Warm buses are nice but not when you are dressed for winter and start dripping sweat. Going back out into the freeze when sweaty is not good. Ask the drivers to keep the heat at a reasonable temp please.
@CstWoolley @TransLink @TransitPolice Where is this
@translink this is weird but there is a propane tank at stop 50743. Not sure if you guys would pick it up or if the city would...
@TransLink Millenium line also affected?
@TransLink Why is Millennium Line being held for delay at Patterson?!?!?!
Not good. “Significant” delays Patterson area. Problem #skytrain @TransLink
@BadetteExpense @TransLink Yes
@BadetteExpense @TransLink Been suck at Holdom for 5 mins
Huge delays on Skytrain this morning be aware. Overcrowding on stations as well. @JanetBrown980 I’m keeping busy though @TransLink 
@TransLink Can you guys at least close the door to our train
@TransLink's method of handling a problem train at Patterson is kicking everyone off the train working fine at 22nd street... What. The. FUCK.
@TransLink can you please explain? This practice makes absolutely no sense.
@TransLink fucking up lunar new year with all these fucking bullshit delays. It's fucking cold man.
@TransLink when you moved the stop at marine gateway for the 100 to bay 2 are you going to put in some benches for your senior customers?
@TransLink Just an FYI your driver of the 105 in New West just skipped picking 3 people up at the Agnes and Merival stop. What's up with that?
@TransLink @JanetBrown980 I had a front row seat to it all
@TransLink whats the delay at Waterfront? Been waiting for 15mins for skytrain
"@TransLink hi, columbia station is flooded with people, could we please get an eastbound train coming? the westbound trains seem to be working fine..."

@TransLink Not at all I think 4 people in it
Commuting via a reliable public transit like @TransLink is so much more rewarding in the morning as opposed to driving in Kitchener. @blinkist &amp; @Flipboard help too.
A @Translink trolley stuck turning off South Granville and and blocking ALL westbound traffic on W Broadway has just been moved! #Vancouver 
@TransLink Really appreciate your bus driving right past me and 3 other people this morning. Great service #169!
@TransLink I know mistakes happen but they should know what they did...
@TransLink @JanetBrown980 Hopefully a light at the end of the tunnel for the rest of the commute! 
@TransLink thank you!
@TransLink @JanetBrown980 Thank you and keep warm!
@TransLink no trains at columbia going westbound? I have seen 6 trains now in the other direction..
"@translink 4 lafarge lake - Douglas trains in a row at lougheed station, and a platform full of people wondering where the waterfront train is! What’s going on?"
Hey @TransLink everyone is waiting at Lougheed for a waterfront train for the last ten trains. What’s up with that???!!!
@TransLink Hell of a time to be stuck in the cold
"Compass Card pro-tip: don’t look at the green screen that often constantly says “Proceed” (@translink poor UX, especially for people with hearing impairment or using headphones, plz improve), look at the LED on the card reader. When it lights up (red) walk through."

"@TransLink Is there another expo train issue? New west station, 20 trains east bound and 1 west?????"
"This new ‘both sides of train opened at same time’ thing at Broadway-Commercial is brilliant! Now you can get groped, pushed, &amp; smashed from TWO SIDES! It’s amazing - there’s still no more actual room on the bloody trains so you get to wait even longer than usual! @TransLink ?"
"@TransLink can you please tell me if the new express buses on the 315,352,354 routes are temporary? These new buses are absolutely horrendous. Lots of people being left in the cold because the capacity of these new buses are a lots smaller. Fix soon pls"

"@TransLink what’s up with expo line to waterfront at metrotown, been waiting for 15 mins"
@translink where are your station attendants/ customer service? There’s someone wanting to ride westbound at new west right now with a bike. Bring popcorn for the show when they try to load it?
@TransLink  it’s -8 outside and the heaters are on low in the skytrains
@jlenn94 @TransLink Could be worse..... You could be stuck at Broadway on a westbound train with both doors open.......
@TransLink New West Station 8:53 
@TransLink Stuck at Columbia. 2 trains in half hour.   Be nice to let us no what's going on??
@TransLink can we get an update on expo line heading west??? Been waiting at Metrotown for nearly 20 mins.... 
@TransLink I’m sitting near a heater. Bit is a light warm air that is blowing.
@TransLink if you want people to use transit they need to have confidence in the consistency of your service. Just waited as 5 over capacity trains passed. Daily problems drive potential transit passengers away
Another day. Another skytrain delay. Sounds familiar???? #commute @TransLink @CityofVancouver
@TransLink 
@TransLink Ok will give feedback thanks
"Can someone from @TransLink tell me how double door boarding at commercial broadway is supposed to be more efficient? Im not seeing it, especially during rush hour."
@TransLink Stations clearing up nicely now. A number of trains rolled in back to back.
Please quantify 'some delays' @TransLink
@TransLink New commercial extension was supposed to make transferring from millenium easier. I have to wait almost twice as long to get on a waterfront train now. What happened?
@TransLink There was no westbound train at scott road for 25 min after you tweeted this-delay is an understatement. Since the train has issues literally every week- you think you guys would know how to manage it better so people who pay over 170 don’t freeze while you’re warm in your office
@TransLink You have a problem driver on #33. He is never on time. Stop 61089 8:14 is literally always late . Today on the 8:25 bus and he drove by us. That bus driver actually called out hey guys those that were waiting for earlier bus here he comes from behind us! NOT OK!!?
"Thank you @TransLink ... I was 20 minutes late for work because the 1 st bus did not show up, and the 2nd bus the bus driver did not allow us (2 people) to come in even though 3 people got off the bus on my stop. Ended up walking all the way to work. So stupid."
@TransLink Y'all realize there's a pigeon problem at #BrighouseStation ?
"@TransLink Pathetic service. No announcement at Lougheed station where ppl waiting on this freezing day. No customer service ppl as well. IMPROVE YOUR SERVICE, IT’s HIGH TIME!!!!!!"
"@TransLink I don’t understand how you have the entire non operating hours to do maintenance, yet you still have these issues during prime rush hour. Stop doing maintenance during your busiest times. Get it together."
Thoughts on the new @TransLink commercial-broadway two-platform westbound system: it doesn’t work.
@TransLink 351 NB seems to have big issues at WRC Bay 5 this morning. Multiple scheduled busses simply didn't arrive. Passengers waiting for more than 20 minutes in sub-zero temps then passed up by a half-full bus. Any explanation for what's going on?
Good morning @TransLink! Is the 255 coming to stop # 51576 anytime soon?
@marshalederman @TransLink It definitely helps the crowding on the platform. But loading/unloading is a bit chaotic.
"@TransLink Went to Patterson cuz it's usually better than Joyce.. waited almost 30 mins for a train. Should've cabbed. I paid two zone for this, why? I swear to God, if you go to raise your prices again, with these increased problems and delays and no actual work done to FIX these things.."
"@TransLink Really appreciate the quick update - you rock @Sethrogen. Also, I miss the sweet, soothing voice of @sethrogan on my morning commute. That laugh.

"@TransLink Ooops, 51756!"
"It is a great city thanks to good city policy back in the 70s that said transit over highways to connect the region. A strong focus/policy/infrastructure support on transit, ped, bike over personal cars has made all the difference. @Dale_Bracewell @TransLink"

@rmchase @Dale_Bracewell @TransLink It can be both
@TransLink Neato!
Looking good Vancouver.  Now other cities are faced with how to reconnect divided regions as funding for transit dwindles and infrastructure crumbles...
@TransLink train has been stopping on and off before commercial station for 5 minutes now and isn't even at the station. Is it because of the train at Patterson thing...?

@TransLink 25 minutes from Nanaimo Station to Burrard at 9 40 am. Usually 10 minutes!
"@rmchase @Dale_Bracewell @TransLink But Portland did all those things too!  The TNCs are increasing congestion and slowing down buses here, as in all dense cities."
@TransLink Well myself and several other people had to call in late for work (I heard the phone calls) because there's been about 15 minutes of delays with this one train so far. So hopefully this is fixed soon...
@TransLink Been waiting 10 minutes now at Sapperton Station for a NB train-issues???
@TransLink I see that issue was cleared an hour ago-now been 15 minutes wait for a train.

@TransLink Maybe you should fix production way skytrains ?

"@TransLink I’m taking the Bolt, thanks"
@TransLink wow again the #28 drives its own schedule all day. Left joyce station early causing me a much longer commute. Left 51779 early as the 25 stopped to drop it drives away.

@TransLink @Amilyntay Done.
"@TransLink Sorry I’ll clarify. The standard coaches that normally have been used, haven’t been on those runs. Instead it’s been a newer series of buses with express bus on the side. They seem a lot smaller and very narrow inside. Not sure is it’s temporary or not 1/2"
@TransLink Also is it still the plan to go with double decker buses on these runs? I found those to be perfect for the volume of people that use these buses

I can’t believe @TransLink is wasting employee time and paper handing out pamphlets about the upgrade at Commercial station. That’s a lot of pointless resources wasted on something that’s going straight into the garbage because there’s no recycling bins handy.

@TransLink the 257 express normally always stops at park Royal but the driver had 15 ppl get off today saying it no longer does.  Can you settle if this is actually true?  The bus was basically empty once he had ppl get off and wait for next non express to horseshoe bay
@TransLink There was no mention of 9.03 and 9.18 not showing up to  bus #50445. Been waiting outside half an hour. 9.33 is here. Why?

@TransLink #58627 502 bus is not full!
"@TransLink I can't remember if I've asked this: are there transit reminders for people not to hug the poles like sloths during rush hour? I realize mornings are hard but if you take up an entire pole like you're a fire fighter going to a call, no one else can hold on, you know? "

@TransLink It's time to take a look at the system a bit. The delays happen too much these days.
@TransLink any idea on the whereabout of the #412 bus due to have left at 0855 from Bridgeport Station
@TransLink I must express my dissatisfaction with the 6 bus during morning rush hour. They are never on time and often arrive full. Understand it may be due to traffic along route 5. Still should increase frequency or have more buses on standby. People are late for work.

@TransLink Thank you
@TransLink Thank you..

@TransLink We found it. They’ve been rerouted to the opposite side of University Drive. We saw the 95 turn the opposite direction but it was just turning around. ?
Hey @TransLink what’s happening with the 84? 
"@TransLink Ok thanks! I was at 50594. Walking up to catch the 99 now, but there’s still a huge line waiting for the bus"
@TransLink when is the 84 to UBC showing up at VCC? Literally been standing here for 20 mins and no buses
"@TransLink No worries, thanks for the info!"
@TransLink It was my first time taking this route so it’s easy to get confused when there is a change!
@TransLink no service at stop 50347?
Hey @TransLink maybe not a great idea to let your bus drivers let people stand outside the bus in this cold when theres no reason to not let them on into the warmth. Just thoughts.
@TransLink how is that officer doing? The one who was shot? So thankful that the shooter has been arrested.

"@TransLink Its alright! Mostly worried for the people who werent dressed for it today. Thank you lots, all warm now ?"
"@WestVanObserver @TransLink 1. Point is that B-Line opposition feeds on misinformation. 2. It’s not that only 73 #westvan residents were consulted, it’s that only 73 responded. Survey was open for weeks, if not months. IOW, it seems WV residents’ outrage at not being consulted was initial apathy instead. ?"
"@WestVanObserver @nigelmalkin1 @CraigCameronWV @TransLink You are completely misinterpreting this. Only 73 RESPONDED. Hardly makes a case that there is overwhelming opposition. Indifference or apathy, perhaps."
"@WestVanObserver @martynschmoll @nigelmalkin1 @CraigCameronWV @TransLink Huh? How many ""fired up"" people are we talking here? I live in West Van and I'm not ""fired up"" in opposition. I fully support the proposal."
"@WestVanObserver @pwatkins63 @nigelmalkin1 @CraigCameronWV @TransLink I'm still at a loss as to why you don't want better transit services in West Vancouver. Something about a few parking spots? You don't like the idea of car traffic flowing better? I just don't get it. Lots of emotion, very little tangible argument."
@TransLink So I have to get to 22nd street skytrain station from New West Skytrain station after class so if the skytrain isn’t working what bus do I need to take

"@WestVanObserver @nigelmalkin1 @CraigCameronWV @TransLink The 3950 figure also reflects the total number of respondents for all the B-line proposals, including those that don't directly impact WV.

".@TransLink is putting pigeons on the pill. This feeder, newly installed behind VCC-Clark Station, will dispense birth control to the pigeons. They say it's ""non-toxic, effective and humane."" @GlobalBC "
@Mat_Hunt @TransLink I amped up from the gym. I'd get waaaaay pissed.
@jarmstrongbc @TransLink @GlobalBC Can we get some of those to dispense birth control to men? Perhaps in snack dispensers close to high-end car dealerships and sports bars?
@jarmstrongbc @TransLink @GlobalBC I await the planned parenthood protesters.
@ctv_shannon @CTVVancouver My husband's business can help keep pigeons away from Skytrain stations. We've sent them information on his company...  @TransLink
@jarmstrongbc @GlobalBC @TransLink Just question... will this birth control harm or affect the reproductive systems of Falcons &amp; other predators that feed on pigeons?
I get it....too many birds. But stepping in unnaturally like this drives me NUTS! ?
Hey @TransLink - great job responding to the #SkyTrain station shut downs last night.  Plenty of staff and security on hand and lots of buses available.  My trip from Production Way-University to King George was only 20 minutes longer than normal - cheers! ?

@jarmstrongbc @GlobalBC @TransLink Your Translink dollars hard at work.
@TransLink it is so frustrating when bus drivers leave before the set time especially when it’s not a frequent bus. The 129 Patterson bus from Holdom
@jarmstrongbc @JesseLonnen @GlobalBC @TransLink @BC_SPCA Bull shit
"@Greenspeeder @jarmstrongbc @GlobalBC @TransLink I say good. Without feeding the birds birth control, there are more birds. Then, your tax dollars are spent on custodians to clean their droppings. This is a way of controlling the bird population so money isn't spent controlling them &amp; putting up fencing etc."
@MineerBrett @jarmstrongbc @TransLink @GlobalBC Seriously? Trans link is spending taxpayers dollars on birth control for pigeons? At what cost.
"? All the world seems in tune on a spring afternoon, preventing pigeon pregnancy in the park ?"
"@momsy49 @jarmstrongbc @TransLink @GlobalBC I imagine it's much, much cheaper than dozens of false track intrusion alarms."
Here are the full details from @TransLink as they team up with the @BC_SPCA to give pigeons birth control at a #Vancouver SkyTrain station ? 
"@ouroborosage @jarmstrongbc @TransLink @GlobalBC only if we can also give them to high income white women who complain about being oppressed,"
"Pigeons on the pill! 
@BC_SPCA says the drug is non-toxic, safe, and doesn't have any effects in mammals, including humans, water runoff, or raptors that eat pigeons. 
Each dispenser costs ~$1,000 but @TransLink expects it will save much more in pigeon-related repair costs"
@TransLink I’m on the 701 (P14015) and the heat is so high it’s like a sauna ? like almost to the point it’s hard to breathe ? I’ve always been curious how temps are regulated on your buses?
"@jarmstrongbc @TransLink @GlobalBC And now that you've told everyone where it is, I expect it to be vandalized or stolen promptly"
I'm writing about PIGEON BIRTH CONTROL. And I insisted on learning the exact mechanism through which the birth control works. Stay tuned for my story in an hour or less... #translink #pigeon #urbanwildlife @BC_SPCA @TransLink

@Greenspeeder @jarmstrongbc @GlobalBC @TransLink Have you ever been to the station and seen all the crap or been crapped on?
@MineerBrett @jarmstrongbc @TransLink @GlobalBC It would be cheaper to tell people to quit throwing bread crumbs etc for the birds. Saw a woman a week ago throwing bird seed on the sidewalk and she had a lot of followers.
@momsy49 @jarmstrongbc @TransLink @GlobalBC I think they could tell people that until they are blue in the face - like they do at Granville Island...and it would still occur.

"@CraigCameronWV @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop Apparently not as much as Nigel. The guy who's speaking up for residents and not what @TransLink and North Vancouver politicians want. 

And does it really matter what I believe? I'm entitled to an opinion. If it upsets you perhaps it's because there's a degree of truth?"
"@FEEZYDoesIT @CraigCameronWV @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink There will definitely be a new Mayor in 3.5yrs Hafeez. Things have been pretty sleepy for the past 10+ yrs, that's all changed now. Everyone has a much better idea of who council members really are."
"@pwatkins63 @CraigCameronWV @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink Every one of my friends in West Van feel cheated. 

If the mayor wants to solve a real issue how about doing something about that sewage stench on 21st exit that's been hitting on the dry days. 

As bad as it is it still reeks less than the B-Line plan"
@TransLink I rode BC Ferries from Horseshoe Bay to Departure Bay yesterday and it cost $127 dollars :(
"@FEEZYDoesIT @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink Hafeez, it upsets me because you don’t have a shred of evidence to support your opinion that the Mayor is selling out the community yet you feel entitled to voice it publicly to 5000+ followers. It’s shameful behavior and unfortunately far too commonplace on social media."
"@CraigCameronWV @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink Evidence? How is pissed of West Vancouver residents not enough evidence for you?

Are you planning on using that line with them when you run for re-election?"
"@FEEZYDoesIT @pwatkins63 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink If some people feel cheated, it’s largely because they have been fed a great deal of misinformation.  We are actively seeking public input. And NOTHING has been decided yet."
"@CraigCameronWV @pwatkins63 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink So their opinion is instantly invalid because you feel they don't have enough information? Their will and desire as the electorate means nothing. 

Sir, you are a civil servant when elected. You represent them. No matter what you feel their information level is."
"@FEEZYDoesIT @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink Evidence to support your harsh accusation, Hafeez.   You’ve accused a dedicated public official of selling out her community, despite the fact that no decision has been made.  In my world, you don’t level such serious accusations without rock solid grounds."
"@CraigCameronWV @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink The evidence is clear - look what's unfolding all around you. 

No one in West Vancouver wants to lose more parking space or street access. Not the businesses, not their patrons, and most certainly the majority who would vote against it, if it were a referendum"
"@FEEZYDoesIT @pwatkins63 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink I don’t need a lecture, Hafeez.  My duty is to do my best for the community based on the best information I have.  If people are misinformed, my duty is to give them access to the facts."
"@CraigCameronWV @pwatkins63 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink You duty is to represent the will of the people not feed them propaganda that @TransLink  wants you to feed them. 

How much are they funding you with? What golden chalice have they waved infront of you to be so bold in selling out?"
"@FEEZYDoesIT @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink Hafeez, I’m not talking about the merits of the b-line proposal.  I have many concerns with it, as does the community. I’m talking about people making baseless accusations. Before rendering judgment, why not wait to see what actually transpires after the process?"
"@CraigCameronWV @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink Because like the majority of people who move around West Vancouver, the B-Line is a negative. 

It's like saying Hafeez why don't you want a lobotomy, if you don't know the full merits of a lobotomy? 

Because I rather not downgrade something that's already at peak capacity."
@TransLink When are the wristbands coming back?
@FEEZYDoesIT @pwatkins63 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink This is so very offensive Hafeez.  I hope you enjoy the weekend.
"@CraigCameronWV @pwatkins63 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink It's a fair question to councilor that's apparently there to serve West Vancouver but is instead vouching for North Vancouver. 

You know what's offensive? You assuming that the rest of us are going to be silent about it. 

Good day sir; please find your moral compass."
@FEEZYDoesIT @pwatkins63 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink I’m not asking anyone to remain silent. I’m asking that people express their views without insulting people or making baseless ad hominem attacks. I don’t think there is any point continuing this online exchange. I’d be happy to meet for coffee and discuss your thoughts.
"@CraigCameronWV @pwatkins63 @TheClosures @maryannbooth @willythesop @TransLink I apologize if you feel my position comes across as an ad hominem attack. It is an opinion that those who are pushing the B-Line are more in service of TransLink than the electorate.

Just show me where the signage is you claim exists along Granville about this issue to tell people not to wait there for a bus after 9 PM
 "
"Lastly @TransLink
Who should I send my bill to for having to go back out to prove you wrong after your bold claim there was signage all along there?"
"@TransLink As I stated in the follow up tweets moments ago.
Thats all nice &amp; good.... for the area immediately around the closed area.
Those 4 blocks away might not know.
Plus, buses stop at 9, Granville is open till 10.
You really arent going to argue your way out of this one."
"@TransLink When you guys first stopped coming along there on weekends after 9, you have VERY SPECIFIC signage stating the times it would be closed.
Now people are supposed to just guess when that is?
As I said, buses stop at 9, streets open till 10, and 4-5 blks away, people might not know."
"@TransLink I have no problem with the detour starting at 9.
I have issue with you not informing an unknowing public.
Roads not closed till 10. As far as public is concerned.... Granville is still open at that time.
Also, past Davie, or Georgia, people might not see know is closed ahead."

No one as of yet disagrees with a line to Park Royal. 

WV has higher demand for parking than buses. It's a simple truth"
@TransLink ?????????????????????
@shelina972 @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth At no point have I been selective about what is shared?   I’ve been very public and tried to share pretty much everything I’ve known since the beginning.  Do you have any examples of where I haven’t?
@CraigCameronWV @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth Perhaps start by not blocking people. You are a politician. So highly inappropriate to be selective as to who can and cannot see your tweets.
"@MachineStopper @CityofVancouver @UBC @TransLink No, but @UBC supports the building of Skytrain extension and there’s an understanding that they will partially pay for it. As Electoral Area E, they also have a rep on Metro Van’s Board of Directors, and I assume, the transit committee. So, what’s the plan, Stan (or, Santa)?"
@shelina972 @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth I only block people who refuse to remain civil.  You’d have a hard time finding many politician more open to debate. I’ll argue the issues with anyone but I’m under no obligation to take personal abuse. It’s no different than walking away from a toxic conversation on the street.
@CraigCameronWV @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth Yes it is. It is social media. You can choose to ignore the comments but blocking people is wrong. The only politicians that do that are ones with something to hide.
@TransLink ummm my transit app says the next like 5 701s leaving from Pitt meadows are cancelled?!
"@shelina972 @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth That is simply incorrect. Social media has rules of engagement, just like any form of human interaction. I interact with hundreds of people by email and online. Some vehemently disagree with me, which is fine. A few just want to wound.  I’ve blocked two, one who lives out of WV."
@CraigCameronWV @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth Hmmm....I’ve heard from 3 people all West Van residents that have been blocked by you. And I’ve never seen anything aside from disagreeing with you but regardless. I don’t even think Trump blocks people and look at what is tweeted to him! Just looks bad to block people IMO.
@TransLink 
"@shelina972 @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth With all due respect, I don’t think you have a clue about the level of vitriol at the moment.  You are entitled to your opinion, of course, but you might feel differently if you were a public official under constant scrutiny and not an anonymous twitter account."
@TransLink It’s all good.  Must be the third party screwing up.  Thanks tho
@TransLink It just arrived.#52717
@TransLink Thank you
@shelina972 @CraigCameronWV @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth If you were paying attention to the unwarranted vitriol some of the supporters were spewing towards others you'd understand why they were blocked. Nobody needs to be subjected to that for an opposing viewpoint. Can't be civil? Expect to be blocked.
@shelina972 @CraigCameronWV @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth Why should a politician have to tolerate uncivil behaviour? If discourse isn't civil there's no reason to keep social media channels open to the abuser. Would you tolerate it if the vitriol were directed towards yourself?
"@CraigCameronWV @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth With all due respect, you have no idea of what I know and don’t know. But do as you please and block who you like, it only serves to remind people that you are selective in what you share and with whom. Have a good evening Craig!"
"@shelina972 @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth Again, and not to belabour this but nobody knows who you are, where you work, where you live, where your children go to school.  I’ve had threats related to all of these.  I’m rarely selective in who I interact with online. I’m not selective in the info I share publicly."

@TransLink I finished the form! Thank you for responding!
@TransLink 410 update please. 61334 is stop number.
"@TransLink Yesterday it was around 12:45. 210, 4, and 211 skipped the stop and today around 3pm the 4 skipped. Plz inform the drivers so passengers like me don't suffer the stress of which stop is in service. I saw an old man rip off the sign b/c the bus skipped the stop"
@TransLink But how short? 40 minutes shortly? Or 5 minutes?
Where is 325 @ 55695 @TransLink

@TransLink hello! I’ve been waiting at stop #58438 since 3pm but the 3:20 bus never showed. What’s the status of that bus?
"@TransLink Ah, but here we are ?. Can't see it down the street. Hopefully it'll magically poof itself to the stop. One can only hope. ?"
@TransLink how’s the 99 Broadway looking? As well as any busses going across the genaville bridge?
@TransLink Snowing in Richmond 3 &amp; Granville now.  Can't see if it's sticking .
@TransLink Yes the bus just pulled in to the stop. Thanks for the quick reply!
@TransLink I heard it's snowing now in Coquitlam. I'm coming home from downtown. Any problems with bus 156 or 153? Or the skytrain?

@TransLink Snow is sticking at SFU. How is the 143? Are they able to come up the hill?
"@TransLink Thank you for the update.  Hope it doesn't get worse than that. 

Good luck to you guys too. Fingers crossed there won't be too many problems tonight."
@TransLink Thank you ??
"@ilovethearts @electricyvr @Eric_Doherty @BCTransit @TransLink As an occasional @TransLink rider with #Compass, that lives next door in @BCTransit's CFV system, I wish BCT would reconsider. Not only should it be Compass style, it should work on both systems. 1 card for all systems in BC, especially neighbouring systems!"
@TransLink any issues on the 20 Victoria? Apparently it's snowing on the south end of Victoria but it's raining near commercial-broadway still.
@TransLink cheers thanks for letting me know.
@TransLink how is the skytrain looking? I need to take Millenium and Expo to get to school this evening and I am kinda dreading it tbh
"Welcome back, snow storm in @CityofSurrey ?? The snow is getitng sticky now and hopefully everybody feels safe and takes care ^^ ??

@TransLink is 116 going to Edmonds delayed?
"@ilovethearts @electricyvr @Eric_Doherty @BCTransit @TransLink At the exchange in Langley, switching between Translink &amp; BC Transit I've seen drivers turn away a number of confused passengers due to the incompatible fare systems."
@TransLink how are the eastbound 95s and 160s doing this afternoon?
"On days like today, I’m exceptionally glad I take transit to work. Bus is zipping along and I’m relaxed and reading. #nostresswinterdriving @TransLink"
"@TransLink Great, thanks so much!"
@TransLink how is the Canada Line looking for this evening?
@TransLink waiting at stop 55761 for the 337
@TransLink would it be possible to get the entrance to the Columbia station on Fourth shovelled/salted? It’s really slippery.
@TransLink Seriously
"@PhilRidinBikes @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @stickers66 It's a @TransLink ""Trip Reversal""  - yes, although very official, it's not well-known and (whilst will be VERY helpful for some at Sapperton) not much use for those with bikes or mobility issues"
@TransLink - good luck this afternoon guys. Deep breaths. 
@TransLink don’t know if you know but the 123 is stuck in the hill on 8th near Carnarvon.
Will @TransLink ever be ready for snow? We'll never know.
@JonJennings @PhilRidinBikes @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @stickers66 @TransLink Or without a Compass card.
@TransLink Can I get an ETA on the bus
@TransLink Thank you!
@TransLink the 129 to Holdom is stuck near Patterson Street because it slipped on black ice or something! The bus behind is stopped too to help. Stay safe everyone!!!
@TransLink how is Skytrain running right now?
@TransLink @TropicalJoss M-line currently stuck at inlet station?
@TransLink What no I’m at Guildford waiting at stop 55761
@TransLink any news on the delays on the evergreen line?
@TransLink any delays for the 156 to braid stn or 156 to lougheed stn?
@TransLink Me and like five other people are waiting in front of the Esso not at surrey central
@TransLink @TropicalJoss Ok great thank you!
@TransLink did the 301 4:45pm bus depart Richmond Brighouse? Thank you :)
@TransLink where’s the 394 bus? ? 
@TransLink any news on the 123 in New Westminster?? So far two buses haven't shown up yet
@TransLink okay we just left the site of the bus stuck! On regular route. Probably like 10-15 mins behind
@TransLink is the 143 to sfu running?
@picantisimo @AM730Traffic @GlobalBCtraffic @GlobalBC @NEWS1130Traffic What happened to those winter tire socks @TransLink was raving about back in Nov 2018? I haven't seen a single bus with them equipped during any snow storm this season. Explain.
@TransLink it feels weird to have both sides door open at broadway. and people are standing still to block the door on the new platform side... it takes time ... ?
"@TransLink what happened to the 4:50 555 fron Lougheed to Carvolth?
 58432 ?&lt;555?&gt; 4:46p 4:50p"
@TransLink Okay perfect thank you!!
@TransLink Thank you people were wondering
@TransLink is the4:45 pm 394 to White Rock Centre running. I'm at King George Station bay 2. Been waiting since 4:35
"@stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit Just realized that abc tagged the wrong transit handle on this thread. Attn @TransLink. Discussing the need for improved access to Sapperton Industrial area for pedestrians, wheelchairs, and cyclists that don't require crossing Brunette at level."
@TransLink Is there anyway it’ll stop operating all together anytime soon??
@TransLink have you moved the 193 stop fir today or is it operating at all.
@TransLink so 33333 SMS next bus isn't kept up to date then? Cause that text indicating a 555 at 58432 was from 4:43
"@PhilRidinBikes @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Oof, guys... not to be a shill, but that's a lot of stuff that isn't in TransLink's purview. They could add a station exit, sure, but they can't solve the generally poor bike/ped access in that area. And that'd have to be sorted out well in advance of TL adding an exit."
@TransLink I meant the 103.
".@TransLink 337 Surrey Central 

55+ minutes late"
@TransLink where the #112 from Edmonds?
@TransLink hey is the 393 at surrey central coming? The 4:41 never showed up
@TransLink - Is the 4:55 601 Ladner Ring at 61326 late?
@TransLink any train delays so far or just buses?
@TransLink I see it but it skipped the stop and kept driving towards Surrey central
@TransLink Someone said the drivers were told it was suspended. Is this true?
@TransLink I understand. I just wanted to let you guys know (: I'm at 160@108
"@TransLink Okay, thanks. Will keep waiting"
"""SORRY BUS FULL"" not what you want to see when it's snowing/raining and there's a lineup of dozens waiting for the #502. @TransLink #vancouversnow"
"@TransLink Not sure about delays. I tried to get on at New West station &amp; he said he was parking the bus &amp; not going up the hill at all. Told us to walk or take a cab because we were SOL. Not mad, I get it but there was no mention of a delay."
@TransLink was the 4:57 129 cancelled?
@TransLink where is the 394 White rock bus #54990 ???? Been waiting since 4:45pm I skipped 321 for this ??
@TransLink there is a lady on the floor of the train sterilizing a needle. On the train on route to king George at Nanaimo
"@TransLink hi, are there any delays along the 130 northbound? Thanks!"
@TransLink So is it coming?
"@PhillenniumLine @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Was just pointing out that the wrong handle was tagged, and that their station is the ""bandaid"" solution is all. OK for the able bodied, sure. But not a big picture solution for sure."
@TransLink how does the 119 from Edmonds looks?
"Like the guy who doored me last year after an @translink driver forced me into the door zone. He got out of his car, angrily yelling ""You should watch where you're going! "" at me as I lay in the middle of the busy next lane, exceptionally lucky I hadn't been run right over."
@TransLink can you tell me when the next 394 will be at stop 55646? On the nextbus map it looks like it's still at Surrey Central..?
@TransLink where’s the 123 from new west station?
@TransLink Stop # 53842
"@TransLink No, it was completely empty and skipped the station entirely"
@TransLink hey! Is 159 braid station boarding anytime soon? It was supposed to be at 5:10 from Coquitlam stations
@TransLink The 5:12 hasn't come by either
@TransLink where are west bound millennium line trains? 4 east bound have past at Gilmore.
@TransLink Sorry it was actually 58342
@TransLink 123 out of commission just had to dump the people off the bus couldn't make it around the corner to go up the hill. All people here stranded to find another route
Hey @TransLink can you teach your drivers about distracted driving? This guy kept having to suddenly brake or accelerate because instead of keeping his eyes on the road he kept looking down at the bag of snacks he was continually munching on. Today at roughly 5:00-5:10PM. 
@TransLink Thank you :)
"@PhilRidinBikes @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Right, but it was never meant to be. That tap-in stanchion was added to the emergency stairs because construction workers kept using it to get into the station without paying. There hasn't been anything there to justify adding a ""proper"" entrance given the work/$ that requires."
@TransLink Maybe put out an alert?
"@TransLink They may be attempting to try again at the station, unclear at the moment"
Thanks a bunch @TransLink. None of your busses can get up the hill from New West. I'm in a wheelchair so I can't get up the hill on my own. So I'm stranded at the station. But you guys are so prepared for winter.
@TransLink Translink officers have taken her off. Thank you for your quick response!
"@paulschratz @TransLink nope....not one bit....we're lucky it happens so rarely out here...in Toronto, meanwhile...."
"@MsMusicKayla @TransLink @TransLink, where the company motto is, 'Fuck You, We Don't Care, Where's Our Money?'"
@TransLink When’s the next one??
"@PhilRidinBikes @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Right, but it was never meant to be. The tap stanchion was added to the emergency stairs so mostly construction folks could tap out w/o getting the full 3-zone charge. There hasn't been enough there (yet) to justify adding a ""proper"" entrance given the work/$ that requires."
"@PhilRidinBikes @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Signage wise, yeah, I mean we maybe could've put some additional info on the overhead sign bad. It was on my list but honestly there were so many other priorities that I was never able to get around to it. Put in a complaint and see if the new sign folks can do it!"
"@PhillenniumLine @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Well, pedestrian traffic to/from a new brewery could certainly increase. Let's hope they aren't crossing Brunette unsafely because the other routes are not viable."
"@TransLink Thanks! the 5:05ish 418 hasn’t shown up yet. Bus stop 60843, do you know anything about that? It’s mostly raining in Richmond"
"@TransLink - sorry to be a pain, but if the 103 Quayside Victoria Hil has been suspended how come The is. I alert?"
@TransLink has failed to prepare again for rush hour. Have seen about 6 almost completely empty trains going the wrong way and 1 packed to the point most people couldn’t get on going my direction. #Vancouver #translink
@TransLink Any update on the situation with the 319? Are there still delays?
"@PhilRidinBikes @PhillenniumLine @stickers66 @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink They might be hoping that everyone uses the crosswalk at Cumberland, down to the park, and along the bike trail there. Metro Vancouver just fenced and paved new trails. Never know who’s talking to who on these things."
@TransLink Bus 123 has now left the station with a new load of people. Don't know yet if they made it yet. Left at station to wait for another bus after I got dumped off the first bus. Do you know when the next one will be?
@TransLink what is going on at commercial?! 
@TransLink is there any chance the 145 is running down the sfu burnaby mountain ?
@TransLink More like was I able to get off the train? Commercial-Broadway platform is so packed no one could get off the train.
Something going on at commercial skytrain station @TransLink #Vancouver 
@TransLink Can you tell when is the next one?
"@PhilRidinBikes @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Maybe so - hopefully! But I mean, breweries tend to locate in areas with poor accessibility due to lots of constraints. Dageraad, for instance, also has very poor bike/ped access but I wouldn't blame TransLink for not providing a more direct connection. That's on the city."
"@TransLink ETA on 326 bus at 96th Ave and 137th St in Surrey (stop # 55739)? Been waiting for 40 min. The 5:06 bus didn’t show yet. I understand there’s massive traffic in Surrey, just want an Eta. Thanks."
"@TransLink hello! bus 101 from 22nd station to Lougheed at bay 10, are they running? Looking for the next departure"
@TransLink Thank you for the offer however my route is limited to two buses of where I need to go and the other hasn't shown up in a while so it's going to be a long wait either way for a bus.
@TransLink Stuck in 502 for 35 minutes to Langley Centre
@TransLink Blah. 5th time in the last 7 nights. I know it's not your job to deal with rants. Just super frustrating.
@TransLink How about 394. People are standing here at bay 2 at king george from 4:30 pm. Bus hasn’t came yet
@TransLink Could you clarify if this means the 354 is going down 32ave or not? It sounds like this means it will be following the 351 route.
@TransLink Wow!
@TransLink One hour + delay to get in the 502 fr KG ???
@PhillenniumLine @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Go back and read. No blame assigned. Just having them join the convo since it technically involves their station. Only thing to point out was that it's only access for able bodied people's as well. An observation if anything.
@TransLink 128 22nd streets what status.  Waiting at braid since 5pm
@TransLink Will do.
"@TransLink 

Another garbage day of service waiting for a non-full train. 20 minutes @ Renfrew and only 1 train. Everyday is the same small trains completely full."
@TransLink It’s 2 buses behind schedule then? Because the 5:35ish should be here soon but I’m guessing it won’t be
@TransLink Thanks
@TransLink 128 to 22nd street what status. Waiting since 5pm
"@PhillenniumLine @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink And I disagree on access to Dageraad access. Does not involve crossing a MAJOR four lane ""highway"" to access it from Production Station by foot. Pretty quiet walk actually. And easily accessed by bike too."
"@PhilRidinBikes @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Ok fair, and my bad re: ""blame"" - didn't necessarily mean you but just in general. And yeah, it's not super helpful to say ""well it's not TL's fault so ????"" but what I'm really getting at is: who do we need to be talking to to get this sorted out?"
"@TransLink hey I think you need to schedule more 95 buses during rush hour!considering 3 have passed with “Sorry, bus full”"
@TransLink Thanks fir that. I still need to know if rye service has been suspended due to the weather.
@TransLink 128 to 22nd street status updates pls
@PhilRidinBikes @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink It's a quiet walk - on the street. There's no sidewalk! At least not on Thunderbird Cres
Hey the train finally come. @TransLink only took about 15 mins to get one to me. With over half the month spent dealing with delays and shit service maybe you should comp people some of the price for next months pass! #Vancouver #monopoly
"@PhillenniumLine @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink This exactly. City, Wesgroup/Brewery District, and TL, since it may be tied in to their existing infra. But more, the developer with deep pockets if you ask me."

"@TransLink just an FYI, the 388 that was supposed to leave 22nd street at 5:40 left the station 6 minutes early. I suspect people will most likely complain because its a 1 every 30 min bus."
@TransLink are the skytrains super delayed as well??
@TransLink is bus 123 at brentwood bring delay right now?
"@PhilRidinBikes @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink Yeah, this sorta touches on what I do now for TL. Typically we'd do an analysis of the likely increase in station traffic due to surrounding development to determine how the station might need to change to accommodate (usually more stairs/escalators/elevators). Then, look for $."
@TransLink No problem. Just wanted to know how long I have before I can thaw out my fingers! Thanks for the reply ??
How’s the status of the 157 leaving burquitlam @TransLink
@TransLink From braid and not seeing both 155 and 128 to 22md street departing braid since 5m

"@PhillenniumLine @stickers66 @anotherbeerco @thebrewerydist @BCTransit @TransLink And I think the cities need to put more onus on the developer to provide the infra needed, in order to get their density approvals and building permits."

@TransLink why has the 19:02 410 bus been sitting at 22nd street since 18:55 (at least) without loading passengers or leaving? It’s 19:10 and we’re all freezing and late. :(
@TransLink I'm at New West station. Guess I should stick to the 90-minute delay since service ends and begins here lol but thanks!
@TransLink someone came by and said there are four shuttyparked around the corner and the drivers said they were waiting hit a supervisor. Route 103
"@TransLink Never mind, it just got here!"
@TransLink I waited an hour and no shuttle showed up at all. I cut my losses and am just walking home.

A ghost bus. @TransLink 
"@TransLink There is NO way the road conditions are bad enough to bail on the fucking job. It was garbage last Monday and they were running slowly, but fine."
@TransLink Totally fair. A bus left at the scheduled 19:20 time. The 19:02 bus just never came/left. I think that’s where the frustration was - 3 buses sitting there and a scheduled run never happened.
@TransLink The 134 from Brentwood to Lake City hasn’t turned up for the 7 or 7:30 pick up from the Brentwood stn bays. Any update?
@TransLink Thank you! ?

@TransLink Getting taxi. Because for something that's supposed to come 15 mins or less. Is stupid.
@TransLink Thank you for the update :) eta?
@TransLink @Ihatetheworld82 I don't understand what the problem is. There is hardly any snow. All the other routes from that station were running fine. There was buses last week when there was tons of snow. Is there a shortage of drivers?

@TransLink What time was this 8.15 bus originally scheduled to come at ???
@TransLink I don't think you are doing your best. Little bit of snow and your buses are so late. Tweet replies should be immediate so that a customer doesn't have to tweet back to back
@TransLink In that case you might want to look at alert section a lot of pissed off people just walked home based on the misinformation
@pwatkins63 @mpjonesy91 @shelina972 @CraigCameronWV @cameronmaltby @martynschmoll @TransLink @maryannbooth Booth looks at it as free money as she’s a figurehead - not really there for the people.

@TransLink “Delays up to 20 minutes” there’s no hyphen between “20” and “minutes” (unless you’re using it as an adjective i.e. “a 20-minute delay”)
@itsjim84 @ilovethearts @electricyvr @Eric_Doherty @BCTransit @TransLink The TransLink legislation does allow for the expansion of TransLink to Hope (I think). That would be another option.

@TransLink Is the WCE running late this morning?
@TransLink what happened to the 101 lougheed station? Been waiting at 16th and cumberland almost 30min now
@TransLink Yeah it just arrived
@TransLink what happens with the route 129???? I got too late
@TransLink what happens with the route 129???? I go too late
@TransLink I’m at stop 55924 and I just saw the 337 leave like 5 minutes earlier than it should have can I get an ETA on the next one
@TransLink what happened to the 22 that would come to knight and 12 everyday at 7:25??? It’s been late three days in a row and I’ve missed my connecting bus everytime.
@TransLink South. According to your online schedule it would be there at 7:26 but didn’t show up until 7:35
"@TransLink Hi, the 407 that was supposed to be at Stop 56447 at 7:32am did not go to the temporary one that was set up due to construction in the area."
@TransLink Whoops Clark. Heading south
@TransLink Bus # 9740. The lady driving this bus this morning has been doing the 240 Vancouver route in the mornings for a while now. I've noticed how agressive she is with her driving.  Today was exceptionally bad.
@TransLink That’s a 10 minute delay though and the only bus before it was at 7:07? It’s been 3 days in a row and it didn’t happen once in the last ~6 weeks.
"@TransLink They changed the route, so instead of turning right onto Westminster Hwy., it’s supposed to go straight on Gilbert Rd to a temporary stop set up beside the flower shop. Is it no longer going to stop there?"
"I have hearplugs, but they are not enough. I can't read, and I can't hear myself think. It's torture. @TransLink this is only a sample #WCE. "
@TransLink What happened to the 7:52 187 at stop 53925 this morning?? Missed the WCE because no one showed up.
"Hey @TransLink, the new digital boards at #Edmonds #SkyTrain are a total game changer! Well done! Wonderful customer experience!"
@TransLink the 19 just passed us by for the 3rd time without stopping to let anyone on. The last one even stopped 20 meters down the road to let a few off. This has gone on for weeks.
@TransLink Major coffee spill on car 342. ***Clean up aisle 343***
who produced the numbers?  @uber @TransLink needs more small electric shuttle busses within and between neighbourhoods like a shuttle from east Van to the train station and stanley park!
Ok wtf @TransLink pls fix ur 323 from surrey schedules. The bus was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago and its been 2 days in a row now ??
@TransLink #4 just passed us again. I've been at my stop for an hour.
@TransLink The driver was on the side taking a smoke when the bus was supposed to be at the bay to let people on and leaving.
@TransLink sigh as always during rush hour 
@TransLink what's with people putting on make up on the trains? I don't want people doing any personal hygiene related tasks on transit. Get ready before you leave home!
Protesting transit. This is the most West Vancouver thing to ever West Vancouver. #bcpoli

"@TransLink Yes, that is the stop I was referring to in my first tweet. Instead of heading straight to the temporary stop, they turned right and went to the original stop instead."
@TransLink The sign that stated this temporary change isn’t even posted at the original bus stop anymore. It’s confusing for everyone and makes us commuters late to work/school/etc. if the bus doesn’t even stop to pick us up.

@TransLink why is skytrsin running so crappy today?
@Miteymiss @fabulavancouver @wendy_waters @TransLink The participating artists and the name of the project are on the inside of the bus. And also here: 
"@mike_in_yvr @JohannZeelie @TransLink Not really down with the language... but he’s kinda right. 
Monthly passes go up but service never improves. 

I have been trying to make things better (phone in, make a complaintX 6 months) and nothing is done..."
@tara_z123 @KenkaNeb @TransLink It is in some areas
@cbcnewsbc public transit is a regular shitshow... gawd help you if you go out in inclement weather and plan on using public transit @TransLink
@TransLink That was the turn around last time drivers were running trains
2 days in a row this damn bus is late @TransLink
"@ENieweler @TransLink If you want to know something, I’ve sent 25+ complaints about that for 3 years."
@TransLink you should make an announcement here. I didn't account for 1 train per 10 mins
@TransLink Good Morning. Here we go again! It's snowing at SFU. Are buses 143 and 145 able to make it to the mountain?
"Good morning @TransLink. Those escalators at Burrard station again. Two going down, only one up. Would be great if that could be reversed please. ?"
@TransLink our train stopped before entering New West station (heading to waterfront). Do you know how long we will have to wait before it moves? There are no announcements
"@SammSmithe @WestVanObserver @michaelgeller @TransLink Actually WV is extremely well served on the Marine corridor by the West Van Blue bus system.
"
@TransLink Sorry. Maybe that was worded wrong but I know for a fact those escalators go up and down. It's usually changed to accommodate crowds during rush hour.
@TransLink millenium line delays this am? At gilmore station and been waiting for longer than usual
@TransLink why is the 555 carvolth to lougheed running only every 11 minutes? Its rush hour...what happened to like every 4 minutes?
@TransLink In 30 years of commuting I have never experienced such consistently unreliable service on the expo line. Manually operating an automated system  just in case there is a problem? Give your heads a shake.
"@365_ToChange @Miteymiss @michaelgeller Yes but the existing service that overlaps is 40 foot buses and they work quite well. Could @translink increase service for the buses that go DOWNTOWN- Yes! 250,257 could use more of them.
But these would be 60 foot articulated buses - 170 a day running empty through WV 6am-1am"
@TransLink Oh is the weather supposed to get bad?
"@365_ToChange @Miteymiss @michaelgeller @TransLink Overlapping existing bus service that only gets to 80% capacity at peak times... also they wanted to close 2 lanes to traffic along marine dr- which North Van isn’t required to do! The lane closures and parking loss would kill businesses in Ambleside.
@maryannbooth 
#westvan"
"@TransLink where the hell are the trains. 
Patterson station platform starting to fill up. 
A few snowflakes killing the trains again??????"
More than 10 mins in between trains... thanks ? @TransLink #imlate
@winkybiker @WestVanObserver @CraigCameronWV @ash_amlani @NorthShoreNews @maryannbooth @TheClosures @TransLink @WestVanDistrict Still trying to figure the facts out there Winky?
@TransLink is 145 production station running?
@TransLink hi! When is the 170 to PoCo station at 58794 expected! I see that there’s a delay! Thanks!
"@TransLink So genuine question, why are we creating delays before the snow starts? Weather is fine right now. But now we're experiencing delays before it starts. Is it because the train managing is not changeable during the day on the fly?"
@TransLink Thank you!! Happy Friday!
@counti8 @Miteymiss @fabulavancouver @TransLink Thanks. I didn’t take the bus; just saw it parked when I got off skytrain.
"@SHW11990 @JohannZeelie @TransLink I never said it was perfect   Issues are bound to happen absolutely.  But having a temper Tantrum because things don’t go your way ? Man , grow up you’re allegedly an adult"
@TransLink Thanks!
"@SHW11990 @TransLink And yes things do need to be improved in places   But compared to systems on the island man, it’s a dream"
@TransLink is there a problem w trains going to waterfront? Three have gone east while Ive been here but none have gone west.
@zyp_zyp @TransLink 
Waits for train for over 5 minutes and none comes. Then suddenly 5 comes consecutively one after another. How pathetic @TransLink . Typical
@TransLink make that 4 east now and none west
@mike_in_yvr @SHW11990 @TransLink You ARE still a TransLink loving whore You have a fucking car so why the fuck do you care anyway. I hope that TransLink building collapse with all those useless arseholes in it. And hopefully happens when you are there getting fucked by the CEO.
"@KenkaNeb @TransLink They manually drive the train because the snow sets off the ""track intrusion"" alert, so having real people allows them to clear the alert right away."
"@FreyaB29587449 @WestVanObserver @CraigCameronWV @ash_amlani @NorthShoreNews @maryannbooth @TheClosures @TransLink @WestVanDistrict I wasn't aware that the articulated buses were going to permanently controlled by malevolent AI, circulating empty at all times of the day and night, completely out of the control of Translink and the district. Oh, and back off on the insults. You're quite stupid, and can't win."
@TransLink When is there not train issues tbh.
"@thx1979 @maryannbooth Great to see a community rally together against probably the worst planning and roll out of a @TransLink proposal I’ve ever seen. Probably the worst initial community consultation ever-that resulted in this mess.
@TransLink @mikebuda you should not have cheated on your homework!"
@TransLink is the 151 going up/down spuraway?
@TransLink For how long?
@TransLink skytrain car 111 westbound announcement speaker seems out of order or garbled.
@TransLink 2 flakes fall = 2 hr delays
“Significant delays” in downtown core says @TransLink because of problem train near Stadium Station. #SkyTrain
@TransLink get someone to burrard to change the direction of the escalators.
"Hey @TransLink. After five westbound trains at Main St, an eastbound one would be appreciated."
@TransLink @patrickallain some announcements would be nice so we aren't wondering if six snowflakes killed the system. ?
"Another seamless Transit commute this morning, thanks @TransLink"
"Nicest, happiest, kindest skytrain operator this morning he deserves a big pat on the back keep us on track manually operating the train.  Even made us laugh through delays #awesome @translink "
@TransLink Cool thanks TransLink ??
@TransLink why are your trains above ground? Put a cover over the tracks so a drop of snow doesn't break the whole god damn system ffs
@TransLink Thanks for getting us there!  You all do an amazing job letting us know and the manual operating must be a strain on all of you but keep us safe and on the go is so appreciated.
"@TransLink Yeah, we are never disappointed"
@TransLink 110 bus at stop 60214 has been consistently late every morning for 8:06am pick up and when they arrive seem disinterested. Not sure if anyone reports anything here but it’s unacceptable
@TransLink can you make some station announcements please? We can't hear the one from the crush loaded train.
"@TransLink 
No.
Need.
To.
Apologize.

JUST
MOVE
THE
TRAIN

AND THEN WE CAN TALK"
@TransLink It’s Friday. I don’t mind a leisurely commute ??
"@TransLink Understanding of that. I just bring it up as before, the direction seemed to be tied to the flow. Majority of people leaving the station in the AM = 2 escalators up. PM = 2 down as majority leaving DT. Seems like just since recent repairs did this change"
@TransLink the announcer for the stalled train delay was very clear and lively just now - usually the announcements are mumbling and bored-sounding #skytrain Is Seth Rogan back?
@translink just wondering when we'll have a day when all escalators at all stations are working properly?
@TransLink Update?
"@Joey_2pointOh @TransLink Yes, he was great!!"
@TransLink Bus 9408 the bus driver is always late. Never seen a grump driver like her before. She may need an anger management course.
@TransLink what's going on with the 312 Scottsdale stop # 54922 last 2 buses are no shows thanks
"@TransLink With these delays, connecting buses at stations tend to get overpacked. What measures are taken to prevent this?"
Kudos to the @TransLink announcer telling commuters to get a mocha today with extra whip. Made me smile this morning! #littlethings
Skytrain PA announcer this morning is AWESOME admits delays and everything ?? @TransLink #skytrain #vancouver
@TransLink You guys have the gall to check peoples passes and charge for this service?  If it's not the trains it's the buses.
@TransLink Is this still happening?
@Obrassor @TransLink I imagine you'll be biking once weather improves?
"@TransLink At VCC, when the arriving train is also the departing one, a huge amount of people go out through the gates , preventing anybody from going in. Missed my train this morning because I just couldn’t get through the gates. Why not reserve one gate for people getting in?"
"@TransLink From about 758 to 816 there were 0, and 1 hard to hear station announcement. The station announcements at Broadway were static."
"@TransLink also, because of the delay, I'm now going to have to pay more because my trip will be longer than 90 minutes. How is that fair?"
@stickers66 @TransLink OH GOD I MISS IT 
@nofunaloud @TransLink no im pretty sure it used to be two up and one down to the trains nd now its reversed so
@Obrassor @TransLink Soon!
@TransLink Simply saying “nothing” would suffice.
"@TransLink They change it all the time, but thanks."
"@thx1979 @365_ToChange @Miteymiss @michaelgeller @TransLink @maryannbooth Nonsense. Businesses consistently way overestimate the number of customers arriving by car and underestimate those arriving by transit, walking and cycling. The businesses will do fine with the bus lane and less parking."
@TransLink hi what’s happening with trains to New Westminster at the moment?
"@TransLink I get that the escalator normally set to go UP is down at #BurrardStation, but there are THREE escalators.  Couldn’t the middle one bet set go UP in the morning?! ?"
"@PoisonPromises @TransLink A build up of snow does. At any rate, that doesn’t mean they have to have fewer trains. Staff all trains or do they not trust their humans to do a good enough job?"
"@TransLink Totally unacceptable explanation. 
Keyword: “calling”
Snow is not here yet so some inept person’s decision in management is making commuters life hell already this morning before anything gets started."
@TransLink can you let the attendants running the trains this morning that the reason people hold the doors is that they are not open long enough for people to get off AND on. Shouting at passengers won’t help...
"Big line up at king george station. No train showed up for half an hour. People already started going back home yelling ""f**k you @TransLink """
"@TransLink are there any issues currently with the 129, 028, or 025?"
@TransLink is the 9am 312 bus coming to 54897?
@TransLink No train metro 15 mins what happened
@TransLink I really don’t appreciate the attitude I got from the driver. He’s was very disrespectful and rude. I had just gotten home from hospital feb 8 and my $52 transportation hasn’t been on my card yet. I told him and I had proof bus # S18136 502 surrey central station
@TransLink metro no train 20 mins. No updates. What happen?
@TransLink super crowed metro station. No train super long
@TransLink Thank you ?
@TransLink skytrain broken again? Waiting at Joyce for about 8 minutes now.
@wrychrd @365_ToChange @Miteymiss @michaelgeller @TransLink @maryannbooth Do you ever go into West Van. Do you want to run their businesses for them ? It’s ok Richard ... it’s done X western terminus will be Park Royal which we support - as we support the B-line Park Royal to Phibbs. NV has no lane closures! Not going to deep cove or Maplewood flats ?
@TransLink hi is the 239 cap u still having delays? And is the 211/212 okay?
@TransLink so i’m assuming the 9:29 will also be canceled?
@wrychrd @365_ToChange @Miteymiss @michaelgeller @TransLink @maryannbooth You will be able to drown your sorrows with dark beer with Martyn when the vote ? goes down soon.
@TransLink So every 15 mins now?
@TransLink Good thank you
@TransLink Why? You guys don’t do anything anyway
"@TransLink wondering if you could print those adorable little footsteps on the floor of your busses and trains, going toward the back. To show people that this is an option."
@TransLink Thanks!
"Skytrain is jam-packed this morning (due to weather, I’m assuming) but there’s no extra time for passengers to get in and out of trains so people are getting left behind or holding doors open. Anything you can do about that, @TransLink?"
@TransLink Traffic along 6th Ave backed up and slow going at 20th St lightss
@TransLink are bus GPS’s functioning normally?
@saynotoslacks @TransLink 23 needs real busses not those suburban shuttles for the 3 people not driving in maple ridge
@TransLink is it still okay to go up the mountain?
@TransLink bus driver is being quite rude to the old man next to me. Anywhere to report this?
@tara_z123 @KenkaNeb @TransLink Coming down hard where I am
"@TransLink Why is real time data down on the day it is needed most, is it ever “real time”?"
@ctv_jon Not driving! They're just watching the tracks for obstacles. They're taking precautions. @TransLink
"@TransLink Thanks wondering what tech you use to update your “real time” system, is it something like location services on a mobile device using Bluetooth or something low tech requiring driver’s attention?"
@TransLink is the #10 bus running? I’m trying to catch it at broadway and Granville
Metro Vancouver snowfall causing Skytrain delays today with conductors at the helm @cbcnewsbc @TransLink 
@JanetBrown980 @CityofSurrey @fleetwoodbia @TransLink @Cloverdale_BC @LangleyCity_ @npachal @CKNW @GlobalBC I think if anyone gave this question 30 seconds of thought one could figure out where the stations will be.
@JillFDrews @TransLink I stand corrected! The view from the passenger seat: 
@TransLink I assume expo is back to as good as we can get it. Your status page still talks about a stalled train from three hours ago
@TransLink are buses getting up to UBC okay? Deciding whether to work from home or not. Thank you!
"Roads are quickly deteriorating.  Just came over Port Mann Bridge into ?@CityofSurrey? this is at 160 and 104, road conditions not great ?@CKNW? ?@GlobalBC? ?@TransLink? ?@SurreyRCMP? ?@KGordonGlobalBC? ?@MMadryga? ?@AM730Traffic? "
@TransLink Shut ‘er down. The snows a’comin. 
@TransLink so what's the deal? 2 buses parked at Joyce SkyTrain. 2 buses due to go 41 &amp; 43. Why are they not picking up? It's a great start on delaying services again. Your driver's should at least try
@TransLink will the run in Stanley Park this Sunday morning affect the 19 bus?
@TransLink I guess they just skipped 2 buses. Great
@TransLink Props to my 008 driver 2562 who is working very hard to get us to Fraser st!! We keep getting stuck and this guy is so patient with everyone and the weather.
Hello @TransLink @SFU any updates?
"@TransLink Real-time info on nb.tra  seems down. Not showing any buses at all. Please fix ASAP, thanks"
@TransLink do you know when is the next 19 metrotown bus coming and my stop number is 51145 thanks
@TransLink The 25? Thanks!
@TransLink 2. 41 buses in a row at joyce. What's going on with 43? Can't you guys do something to help out? Could you snow plan not involved you managing the routes?
@TransLink where is 43 bus?
@TransLink 43 bus??? Whete
@TransLink 43 bus more then40 min wait????
"@SFU so I can see buses on Burnaby Mountain getting stuck out my window, and people walking. Any chance there's a @TransLink update coming to give people a heads up?"

@TransLink Where's the 143 going to SFU? Has not shown up for the last three scheduled times.
@jjhorgan @TransLink with the incompetency of TransLink. Why are we investing so much into it. Snow days are ridiculous not managed every time. Everyone is late. They need to provide decent service!! Why let ppl freeze when buses are 30+ min late &amp; driver just sits there. #818001
"With current snow conditions @TransLink is changing over to 40-ft buses to SFU's Burnaby campus. If you are taking transit to Burnaby Mountain today, please expect some delays. Please follow @TransLink for the latest alerts."

@TransLink is the 95 bline running? Or am I stranded on the mountain ?

@eileenfuuu @SFU @TransLink Your employer gave you a valid answer. Your entitlement is showing.
@TransLink Any delays on any of the 3 train lines currently..?
@TransLink how are the buses looking for 129 &amp; 133
@SFU #sfu
@TransLink Thank you!
"@TransLink can you please provide an update on #9 buses, eastbound on Broadway?"

@TransLink 59842
@TransLink is the 211 running on schedule this afternoon?
@TransLink any news on the 17 downtown on why stuck at Hamilton/Robson near 20mins?
@TransLink no 17 service at Nelson? ETA??
"@TransLink Half empty, no other busses as far as I could see, and already late. Lateness is understandable, and maybe he felt like he couldn’t pull over there, but he outright wouldn’t let me on at the next stop, and only did once I wouldn’t stop running after him and asking to get on."
@TransLink driver just drove past me. No stopping. #144 #52761. I even waved. Please hire people as drivers. Not jerks.
"@TransLink :: How are you guys preparing for any potential snow issues during rush hour later today? 

Thanks so much!

#TransLink #shouldIleaveearly? #rushhour #BCsnow"
@TransLink 3 busses that I can see stopped in a row. I see the mechanic truck now.

@TransLink any delays with the 100 marpole?
@TransLink Ok. Thanks
@TransLink also what’s the stop number for the 100 marpole at marine and Fraser?
@TransLink   Is the 145 from production station delayed?
@TransLink is the 373 running on time?
@TransLink any update on when to expect the 95 at Gilmore/Hastings westbound?
@TransLink Thnx
@TransLink confused about the detour for the 25. Sitting at Slocan and 22nd wanting to go west. Eta?
@TransLink when is the next 25UBC/brentwood station coming
@saltysun @TransLink Did you make it up?
"Good.Doing what must be done...
@CityofVancouver shovelling and salting at transit bus stops today. (YEP cities have to maintain the bus stops).
#16 bus is packed right now, btw. Buses having issues in freezing slush. Looks like people coming home early from work.
@TransLink "
@TransLink How about the 33 going to Ubc at stop 61114
@qparadox @SFU @TransLink Still stuck?
@TransLink How can I get to that from production way?
@TransLink Thank you!
Are there currently any delays for the 99 leaving UBC? @TransLink
@TransLink why the trainng bus can drop off the passengers? 
@TransLink is the bus still running from Brentwood to UBC for number 25?
@TransLink what is the ETA to have this back up? since it's more important than ever when there are substantial delays system-wide
@TransLink hey I’ve been sittin on the 312 for ten mins waiting for the driver to come back n driver his late  why  all day you transit drivers been late can’t tell me the condition of the road cus all week it’s been pure ice  on the roads no problem
@TransLink Is there delays on shuttle?
"Thx @MayorStewart for showing how Skytrain concrete pylons are decorated in Coquitlam. In Kuala Lumpur, the pylons are used to generate revenue! An idea for @TransLink? "
@TwistedOutcast @TransLink Hello. I was in the same situation as you. Take 144 and get off at Sperling Stn and then take Skytrain back to Production. Good luck and be safe.

@KahlonRav @TransLink @BowinnMa You can always stop by and visit us when you are in Vancouver!!
"@joeyconnick @TransLink I wouldn't hold your breath. I'd be willing to bet that they use GPS tracking and an algorithm to predict arrival time, and that algorithm probably doesn't work with the unpredictability of the current road conditions."
@TransLink When is the gondola project going to start construction?
.@translink any 119 buses going towards metrotown? My friend and i have been waiting ~30mins at bus stop # 52458 :)!
@TransLink any update on the 145 to sfu ?
And both moving at full sprint! BC-Parliamentary-Secretaries-#publictransit-powers-activate! Go Go @TransLink....Rangers?
This is awesome to see.
@TransLink are there any delays for bus 152? and what about expo line? to king george?
@TransLink @amblingpanda Thanks for letting us know. We did receive reports of this and have advised the appropriate crew.  ^LM2

"Please Note: @TransLink  is changing over to 40-ft buses to SFU's Burnaby campus. If you are  taking transit to Burnaby Mountain today, please expect some delays.  Please follow @TransLink for the latest alerts."
@TransLink hi! Are skytrains running on schedule or are they being manually driven?
It was like a BC Parliamentary Secretaries #ExpoLine #SkyTrain relay race. ?
@TransLink What about the 144 to sfu ?
On the @TransLink Skytrain. At least i can get to a meeting on time 
@TransLink Is the 26 bus from 29th Ave Station running normally?
Love this. Elected leaders who actually ride #PublicTransit! ?

@TransLink 26 bus is always a painto wait for. Never on time ? 2 scheduled bus never showed up. Been waiting for more than half an hour now.. sad
@KahlonRav @TransLink @BowinnMa Number of British Columbians convinced John Horgan thinks he is Captain Kirk from Star-trek &amp; should be working at Wal-mat in the toy section

@TransLink y’all please get better at dealing with snow
"@TransLink hi, how are the 41/43 running right now?"
@TransLink @CityofSurrey Been waiting for this!

2 of my favourite MLAs doing the peoples business. #surreybc #bcpoli
@TransLink @BowinnMa @jonathanxcote @CityofSurrey @randeepssarai All nice but the new gates are bypassed daily so fare evaders still exist ?
So impressed with the new @TransLink Expo Line Station #SurreyBC  Cenral location. With a beautiful  piece of art in the spacious  entrance AND the escalator works.  Should be open to the public soon. 
@TransLink Hi is 186 Hampton park and 187 Coquitlam Station still operating regular route? Thanks!
Expo Line station upgrades - done! Surrey Central opening v soon. Celebrating in #SurreyBC now. Building a more livable region #MetroVancouver @TransLink @randeepssarai @jonathanxcote @BowinnMa @CityofSurrey 
@michaelgeller @MayorStewart @TransLink I sure wish they would find a way to beautify the SkyTrain pylons along Stewardson Way in #NewWest. A prime opportunity for some public art along that bleak stretch.
#WestVan residents opposed to @TransLink's #BLine bus plans turned out in force for a consultation meeting

Hmmm ? but to Feezy’s point, no Mark Sager would be Mayor. Jim Finkbeiner would be a Councillor.

@TransLink Oh ok thanks :)
"@Svend4MP @NorthVanRT Pfffff tea on screen lmao ?

@TransLink there's an unsupervised train on the Millennium Line.
@TransLink @BowinnMa @jonathanxcote @CityofSurrey @randeepssarai Was just looking at it this morning thinking it must be opening soon! Haha Good guess!
@CitizenYan @CatherineOmega Yeah that's 100% illegal and harassment. @TransLink what say you? Do we allow religious groups to solicit on transit now?
"@CitizenYan @CatherineOmega Yeah that's 100% against the rules and it's harassment.

@TransLink is there trouble with the 502 headed west out of Langley center?
@TransLink Can we get an update on the status of SFU buses? Everyone who transmitted up here is trapped without service. I understand not having service during the snow but now the roads are clear and there is still no service?!

Where’s the 257 for Granville and Georgia? Is there somewhere to catch the detour?"

@TransLink Thanks. Announcements are off period on this train FYI
@TransLink what’s up with 246 service downtown with the pipeline protest blocking Georgia? At stop 59550 hoping to get to North Van?
@TransLink why does my bus schedule app sometimes have live GPS time estimates and sometimes has estimated times for the next bus? The system seems inconsistent. The GPS estimates would go a long way to managing rider expectations.
@TransLink ?
@TransLink Can you confirm this? Bunch of people waiting for the 246 and it doesn’t seem to be coming to 54444
Shout out to the @TransLink bus and train drivers who saved thousands of Metro Vancouverites from winter road rage this morning. 
And bonus points for @Translink for this cute ???? moment in a non-Pride edition of @thebuzzer

@TransLink @majieric Don’t you think it’s ridiculous that you don’t have an official app?
@TransLink @majieric I am pretty sure I just submitted a recommendation.

"I'm quite a calm person but when the bus you are connecting to leaves just as your bus pulls in behind it I get a twitch in my eye. 
@TransLink , please say soothing words to make me feel better."

"@martynschmoll @FEEZYDoesIT @CraigCameronWV @pwatkins63 Wow I can see Martyn? Let’s stop for one second Martyn?

@TransLink @BowinnMa @jonathanxcote @CityofSurrey @randeepssarai It's taken to long and and is the main platform being redone with glass windows and new signs for Skytrain times
"@TransLink Yes as a regular transit user I know to wait at the pole, I was able to see them stop at the stop before mine. Since they didn’t stop or slowdown to stop I wasn’t able to discern if it was a mobile or handset but I’m sure translink has records if a driver calls in via handset."
@TransLink Hello is the 28 running without snow related delays this morning? And the sky trains?
@KahlonRav @TransLink @BowinnMa Yeah.  We remember the Skytrain ticket debacle rather well.  :)
@TransLink Does that affect 100 Marpole bus at the Patterson stop 52200?
"Evidence over emotion? NIMBYism takes many forms.  Well done ??@chrismbryan? and ?@TransLink? for focusing on the greater need. Opponents pan TransLink B-line bus plan for West Vancouver, via @VancouverSun  "
@KahlonRav @BCNDPCaucus @TransLink @BowinnMa Parents consider lawsuit against NDP Minister of Justice after waiting months for FOI request with no response. PARENTS EXPOSE MANY DIRTY POLITICIANS &amp; SCHOOL OFFICIALS IN THIS ONLINE PETITION (currently lawsuit filed against VSB)  
@YVRHousing don't expect @TransLink to swallow it either. They demand density before they will expand service. We've asked for increases in both density and transit in Dunbar for decades. City won't do the necessary zoning TransLink won't increase service. #vanpoli
"@mforsis @TransLink It's relatively easy to add capacity by adding buses, but I don't see why TransLink would run buses that are mostly empty"
@vangardea @abundanttransit @TransLink Why do I get the impression they’re not supposed to jam a water bottle under the throttle to drive the train? :D
@TransLink Not helping at all.

@TransLink what is the status of the #9 and #3 bus routes? Are they running on time? Thanks.

"I ran for a bus, skidding through the slush. It pulled away when I was right there. I flipped off the driver. ??? I've been feeling bad about it ever since. If you drove the #20 &amp; I gave you the finger, please accept my apologies (and a coffee?) @111Unifor @TransLink"
@TransLink Thanks. Eastbound at Broadway and Oak and then northbound at Broadway and Main.
@TransLink are buses still coming up Burnaby Moutain to SFU? I'm waiting at the bus loop but there are no buses
@TransLink any delays to 210 Vancouver from 54002 due to snow?
@TransLink I know that but even your Customer service rep saw smokers they don't do anything as well. And your signs are relatively small. And there is no sign the other side. Hope you would do little bit more your part.
"@TransLink The 145, no bus has been here for at least 15minutes now though"
"@TransLink Good morning, looks like 2 95s are stuck at Gaglardi and Broadway. Any updates for SFU routes? Are other buses able to make it up okay?"
@TransLink is the 95 running from SFU ?
@TransLink Thank you.
@debbielovecnd @TransLink Agreed. My asthma gets triggered at work with doing the grill. Doesn’t help when ppl are smoking anything 10 feet away from you.

@ValerieMak @TransLink They change them twice a day.
And that’s almost it from the first @MetroVancouver #CouncilOfCouncils meeting of 2019 - except for an update from @TransLink and Geoff Cross. 
Ridership growth in the @TransLink service area is exploding - way faster  Jan population growth and way faster than any other region in North America. #CouncilOfCouncils 
?@MetroVancouver? #councilofcouncils ?@TransLink? update: #ridership is booming! 
.@TransLink update @MetroVancouver Council of Councils...booming ridership as shown here. Translink looking to expedite projects where there is a pressing need. #publictransit #metrovancouver #vanpoli 
@TransLink @CTVVancouver Not Acceptable! Buses are Main Causes of Blocking Roads &amp; Hills! All Buses should be able to drive in snow if roads are open. You are paid by the Cities and tax payers!! Trying to guess which routes deserve winter Tires affects users and forces more unsafe cars on roads! #unsafe
"What comes for @TransLink after the 10-year vision? 
Here are the three identified key questions for the Regional Transportation Strategy. Lots of public engagement this summer. 
#CouncilOfCouncils "
Wrapping w @TransLink update. Key message that demand and ridership increase - 17% growth last 3 years - is outpacing system investment. Oddly no mention of extensions to Arbutus or to UBC. Regional public engagement coming up 2019/2020. 
Tap into any @TransLink? panel &amp; learn why even a non–transit-user should keep an ear to the ground *How might regional values be best imbued into Vision going ??? Municipalities will’ve 2 mesh on some of this while pigeons (#donotfeed) keep us on our toes
@TransLink Are the buses running to SFU?
"So what you’re saying is, if you provide people with transit options— eg, in my backyard, Evergreen Extension — they’ll use it. Wow. Crazy, eh? #bcpoli #transit #publictransportation @TransLink @abundanttransit @MayorStewart @BradWestPoCo"

So pleased to see @TransLink integrating art into their new stations. #SurreyBC #bcpoli 
@CityNewsVAN @TransLink I hope there are some security upgrades also...I fear for my life going to that station at night. Another friend was jumped by 4 men at this station last night while drop off his 6 yr old son for hockey. I never want my kid to stop here.
@TransLink how is the expo line skytrain doing heading to Granville from king George?
"There is visible progress on the planning for the extension of the Expo Line along Fraser HWY from KG Station to Langley Centre. A new website for the Surrey-Langley SkyTrain was launched by @TransLink, replacing the website for the cancelled LRT line.

@TransLink why the 144 still not coming
@abundanttransit @TransLink @mrmathewbond I feel the exact same way about @mrmathewbond
"@abundanttransit @TransLink @mrmathewbond The models that are used to estimate transit usage and future traffic conditions are not perfect, but developed with plenty of research and calibration to provide reliable results for decision-making and applied worldwide."

"@thx1979 @ash_amlani @JaneSeyd @BrentRichter @NorthShoreNews @TransLink Glad you support improvements to the 250 and 257. B-line improvements including bus lanes will help improve service for the 257 and especially the 250. Assume you support these improvements, right?"
@RogersArena @Canucks @TransLink @fr_aquilini this is when the people need @lyft
@RogersArena @Canucks @TransLink Okay thank you!
"@LisaDominato @TransLink @MetroVancouver ½ There’re questions that need to be asked &amp; answered impartially: 1) the ‘need’ @ the moment on Broadway’s 4000pphpd. Skytrain &amp; LRT can provide 15000pphpd. Skytrain costs $$7B, 12km Clark-UBC, LRT $1-1.5B, Brentwood to UBC, 21km. Why spend +/-5.6 Xs more for the same ridership?"
"@RogersArena @Canucks @TransLink Thank you for letting me know, Appreciated."
"@LisaDominato @TransLink @MetroVancouver ? 2} a major earthquake’s predicted in the next 30 years. Which would you prefer to repair, a surface LRT or a SKYtrain SUBway? 3} The SKYtrain SUBway estimates are $495/km, +/-2 Xs higher than typical NA subways. Why? #vanpoli"
"@defnotacanuck @RogersArena @Canucks @TransLink @fr_aquilini @lyft Lyft is already a sponsor for Canucks they have to wait till September to start, thank our mayor and local gov for this long delay."
@LisaDominato @MetroVancouver @TransLink Indeed. SKYtrain SUBway locks in rows of high energy consuming concrete &amp; steel towers along Broadway; LRT allows 3-6 storey green wood frame hsg in all 22 neighbourhoods. Which City’d be more livable &amp; use less energy? The transportation system determines the City’s built form.
@RogersArena @Canucks @TransLink What no Uber or Lyft to use
@RogersArena @Canucks @TransLink What about ride share? 
@Bill_McCreery @LisaDominato @TransLink @MetroVancouver Pretty easy answer bill @vancouverdlc
@Beckham10 @defnotacanuck @RogersArena @Canucks @TransLink @fr_aquilini @lyft Oh ya sure a bunch if lift/uber cars trying to drop people off at the game/other events sounds like a great idea
@TransLink why can’t the 229 and 230 actually wait for the disembarking Seabus passengers BEFORE it leaves? Seriously!? Ffs...no reason for bus to leave 2 minutes before Seabus arrives so ppl wait another 15
@wrychrd @ash_amlani @JaneSeyd @BrentRichter @NorthShoreNews @TransLink Compromise?
Not sure which civic body is responsible for the Grandview cut. But this slope at Clark Drive and Grandview Hwy is literally a garbage dump. ?@TransLink? ?@CityofVancouver? ?@CNRailway? 
"@rmfaris I support the B-Line from #WestVancouver Dundarave to #NorthVancouver Phibbs Exchange. Shorter commute times to work/home, increase in business, seniors will have better access, decrease of road congestion and WIn, Win for all municipalities. @TransLink needs to put it in."
"@northshorejoey @NorthVanRT @rmfaris @TransLink 
And you don’t live in #WestVan"
@northshorejoey @NorthVanRT @rmfaris @TransLink You know about elections right?
"@thx1979 @NorthVanRT @rmfaris @TransLink I've seen this and I don't agree with you. I support the B-line, as I'm regular transit user and increasing the commute with fewer stops will get everyone to their destination."
"@northshorejoey @NorthVanRT @rmfaris @TransLink No it won’t. It gets them close to their destination if they’re going Dundarave to Phibbs. Doesn’t go downtown ? 
1km between stops.... that’s great for seniors and people with 
mobility issues isn’t it! 
#WestVancouver"
@northshorejoey @NorthVanRT @rmfaris @TransLink Empty buses 6am-1am isn’t for #WestVancouver we want the improvements we need @TransLink
"@thx1979 @NorthVanRT @rmfaris @TransLink I won't be changing my mind about the B-line servicing North Vancouver to West Vancouver. The bus isn't servicing downtown. As you don't support it, that's your choice and I support what you don't want. Which is my choice."
@thx1979 @northshorejoey @NorthVanRT @TransLink This is a broader issue than just West Van. Maybe if you stopped seeing West Van as some sort of Eden-like bubble you might be able to see the bigger picture.
@thx1979 @northshorejoey @NorthVanRT @TransLink You obviously aren’t one of the many trying to commute across the vastness of the North Shore at those times for work. Give your entitled head a shake!
"@thx1979 @NorthVanRT @rmfaris @TransLink Many people work very early and late, including in your neighbourhood of West Vancouver."
"@TransLink @eurogoldenight @thebuzzer I suppose this is only true if your endpoint is Vancouver. The 555 is consistently busy both on and off hours, yet it seems to be the most underserved route from Lougheed stn. When are we going to get real service improvements?"
@untaymed13 @eileenfuuu @SFU @TransLink How do you know that to be the case?

@maryannbooth"
@kcw_022 @abundanttransit @TransLink @mrmathewbond Speaking of sampling bias: 
@rmfaris @mpjonesy91 @thx1979 @WestVanRT @NorthVanRT @TransLink 
"@WestVanObserver @abundanttransit @TransLink @mrmathewbond A few things: 1) The survey is for four B-Lines across the region (North Shore crosstown, Surrey/Langley, 41st/UBC, Lougheed to Maple Ridge), which is why it's no surprise that respondents come from across the region. Moreover, they can choose one or more B-Line to respond to."
"@WestVanObserver @abundanttransit @TransLink @mrmathewbond 2) People across the region as a whole contribute to local transit funding, suffer from congestion and environmental damage caused by GHG emissions. Ppl who're interested in going to West Vancouver should be able to leave a response even though they don't reside in the muni."
@TransLink  What gives?
@anothermikew @SFU @TransLink ???
@mpjonesy91 @northshorejoey @WestVanRT @NorthVanRT @rmfaris @TransLink Haha joey doesn’t get it
"@WestVanObserver @abundanttransit @TransLink @mrmathewbond 3) The Dundarave/Phibbs B-Line is part of the North Shore Area Transit Plan completed in 2012. Back then, all three municipalities in the North Shore were consulted on the plan. The line was ultimately identified to be a medium-term priority. "
"@WestVanObserver @abundanttransit @TransLink @mrmathewbond 4) And ofc, the line was also part of the Ten-Year Vision / Investment Plan, which has undergone consultation multiple times before and after the referendum. Yes, I know that the referendum was defeated - but people were pissed about revenue source, NOT the transit plan."
"@WestVanObserver @abundanttransit @TransLink @mrmathewbond 5) Based on data I have at hand, WV population is roughly 1.7% of regional population in 2017. So no, while the sample size is relatively small, it's not particularly under-represented in this sample."

"@alt130 @untaymed13 @SFU @TransLink Because it was. If you actually were on the mountain you would have seen all the out of service busses stuck on the side of the road, which is why the RCMP even advised that no one go up. ??Thank you, next. #troll"

And don’t expect to see @TransLink having any in their fleet. Then again...
"@kcw_022 @abundanttransit @TransLink @mrmathewbond I appreciate your response.  If the sample were representative of the WV population, there’d be no uproar here. Could be due to self-selection bias since transit users more likely to respond to Translink surveys, but dangerous if this sample is deciding on BAT lanes for district."
"If a community has a bus service that @TransLink wants to switch to a B line service but the community is adamantly against, why not increase the frequency of the current transit to prove the need?"

"@TransLink Thats really weird and kinda mess up the schedule. Hopefully, u guys can fix that mistake and I never stop loving to use ur app."
I have to give the team over at @TransLink and #CanadaLine attendants for resolving the medical emergency at Marine Drive in a timely and effective matter. I hope the individual who accidentally fell onto the tracks at Marine Drive gets better soon and makes a full recovery.

@adele_chow @FEEZYDoesIT @thx1979 @grahamamcisaac @winkybiker @majesticsunny @Zahra_Premji @cbcnewsbc @TheClosures @bcndp @TransLink And your point is? West Van has been the brunt of petty jokes for years. People in Vancouver must have a thin skin because we don’t care over here!
@TransLink It's been 13 mins since the scheduled time of the bus. Provide an exact time the bus will b here
@TransLink how late is 375 at stop 56064..I was told 13 mins..it's been over 13 mins now. Is the bus canceled ??
@TransLink you guys need to provide better and efficient customer service..bus 375 is always late on Sundays. Supposed to be at stop 56064 at 1.07 pm. Change bus time table if you cant run on schedule. Pathetic!
@TransLink I was able to get on the bus..but I dont understand why this bus is so late. It's always consistently late on Sundays. Do you guys even try to identify the problem ?
@TransLink Who else ready for natural selection ??????
"@TransLink so just was waiting for the 103 to Victoria hill, and was standing at the stop and the bus driver completely by passed me and it was not full at all. Please tell why this happened? Super annoyed"
@TransLink where’s the 229 bus scheduled for 1:36 pm at stop 54142
@TransLink Thank you that does make sense. The reason I ask is I hope people feel empowered to use this access if needed and not make unsafe choices. So was seeking clarity on the doors mixed messaging.
@TransLink wondering about westbound train to VCC at lougheed. 2-3 trains have passed by with Production being terminus stop.

@TransLink The number is 323 and 327
"@frenchpressme @TransLink Yes, it's definitely an unusual route. Thanks to Translink's ""trip reversal"" feature, if you're able-bodied and have a Compass card, it also provides safe and FREE access from  East Columbia through the station to Spruce, bypassing Brunette"

@2RL_27 @TransLink This is a rhetorical question.......
"@HaseosAnimation @TransLink @tenleid It's pretty mind boggling. My family is from a developing nation, people are literally dying to get vaccinated there. This blows my mind! "
@TransLink what's happened? 
@TransLink Car collision ?
@TransLink probably the only thing I hate about public transit is the bus driver's union which makes disciplining rude drivers almost 100% impossible. And the sad thing is it's these rude and inconsiderate drivers that ruin the system for everyone.

"@CogentthoughtsW @amybsea @mpjonesy91 @MattFoulger @Natluvscamping @nadia_stewart @GlobalBC @TransLink If you feel there is a safety issue at risk, that is legimitate concern and you should ask for better clarification on this from TransLink. But to ask why a school? Because traffic generated by parents dropping kids off everyday is tremendous. Kids should be using  busses."
"@ivegotnotalent @HaseosAnimation @TransLink @tenleid Exactly! People shrug it off because they've never seen the devastation that preventable diseases can cause. Meanwhile, over a 100,000 people around the world have died from the frigging measles in the past couple of years."
@SFU @TransLink Thanks SFU. The roads are clear so it's easy driving in.
@shazeentejani_ @CogentthoughtsW @mpjonesy91 @MattFoulger @Natluvscamping @nadia_stewart @GlobalBC @TransLink But the BLine only has one stop in the catchment so it won’t help get kids on buses. And many people live on the mountain so it’s service north-south that needs to be improved.
"@martynschmoll @FEEZYDoesIT 2/2 create a transfer hub at marine &amp; CapRd. &amp; cut PR or any other destination within #westvan out of the transit plan.

If they want isolation, give them isolation. @TransLink #Jmho"
@TransLink one of your buses just drove by about 5 people without stopping at the stop. Bus was empty (first stop on route 240) and it was the scheduled pickup time
Freaked out after what happened on the bus.. thanks @TransitPolice and to the @TransLink driver who kept us all safe. This guy is insane (when drunk). I'd love to see the footage from the bus eventually! Hopefully @cqrcmp can find him.. 
"@TransLink Downtown side, across from the library"
"@TransLink @TransitPolice @cqrcmp No problem, that driver did a amazing job letting my young siblings get onto the bus safe, and myself when it looked like.the guy was about to pull out a knife on me. He needs a bonus or something lmao. He could've just saved me/them from getting stabbed."
@TransLink @TransitPolice @cqrcmp Gladly!
"@amybsea @CogentthoughtsW @mpjonesy91 @MattFoulger @Natluvscamping @nadia_stewart @GlobalBC @TransLink I completely agree. I grew up on the mountain for most of my life and would drive to get to marine before catching the bus. The proposal is not perfect, but it’s an improvement. Provide quality feedback to TransLink (ie. school service, closer stops) so we can get kids on buses!"
@ArmstrongPjames @TransLink People who don't vaccinate their children should be blasted to the sun
"@TransLink Definitely! Didn't seem so bad at first, just a drunk rider, but I let them know as soon as possible. It escalated extremely fast at the end. Was in contact with Transit police, was told they (I'm assuming RCMP) were looking for him. Just glad everyone is safe!"
"@ATolentino088 @ivegotnotalent @HaseosAnimation @TransLink @tenleid Because of malnutrition. Vitamin A deficiency can result in severe measles. When I was a child we all got measles, so did my parents and grandparents. In the past measles was very serious due to malnutrition. With the decline in scurvy came the decline in disease mortality."
@TransLink complaint for the 151 bus from Burquitlam station. In both the app and the paper on the bus stop it says it comes at 8:01 pm. This bus always leaves minutes earlier and doesn’t consider the fact that the skytrain gets here literally just on time to take it!!
"@lynnvalleytoday @martynschmoll @TransLink Most people are fine with the b line till Park royal. That's the thing; everyone keeps painting West Vancouver residents as these anti B Line Extremists when in reality they're B Line realists. 
I think that's a reasonable and fair solution. One that works in everyone's interest"
"@FEEZYDoesIT @lynnvalleytoday @TransLink Hilarious. “We’re not against [transit] [bike lanes] [affordable housing] ... this just isn’t the right location.” Literally, the number 1 NIMBY trope on the NIMBY bingo card."
"@FEEZYDoesIT @martynschmoll @TransLink Thing is, the BLine isn't for the people who live in #westvan, it is for the people who work in west van. 

Any BLine that terminates at PR is only marginally better than existing service, therefore pointless.

"@pwatkins63 @martynschmoll @FEEZYDoesIT @TransLink Thing is, if you divorce @TransLink I would say absolutely no translink busses should cross the Cap and enter #westvan. ferry bus should go up cap rd to highway west to ferry.

@dianamoher @ATolentino088 @ivegotnotalent @HaseosAnimation @TransLink @tenleid It's mainly from the lack of vitamin A in the diet. I had measles and it didn't cause a vitamin A deficiency. I also had good immune responses to rubella and chicken pox. 1/2
@dianamoher @ATolentino088 @ivegotnotalent @HaseosAnimation @TransLink @tenleid Mothers in developing countries are often vitamin A deficient due to diets low in vitamin A and from high fertility and prolonged breast feeding and children's diets are low in vitamin A. 2/2 
@dianamoher @ATolentino088 @ivegotnotalent @HaseosAnimation @TransLink @tenleid Not a noticeable deficiency anyway. At any rate I had a chance to restore my vitamin A stores with diet whereas those in developing countries often don't get to.

"@TransLink Well I’m now late, but luckily my employers are aware this is typical of translink and don’t mind. One of my employers does prefer drivers because of our service inefficiencies.

"@TransLink No worries, I’m now late. My employer is are aware and does not mind because they are aware this is typical of your service. One of my other employers does mind and would discriminate for inability to achieve contracted outcomes within hours because I used transit to commute."
Oh ya? What did they say.
@robertpwillis @TransLink Check out @carrot_rewards. Used them and was dissapointed with engagement numbers. Not sure what BC presence is like but growing.
@TransLink I think this line is suggesting you should find a replacement bus going in the opposite direction as this is now the 4th 240 that has failed to show up on our traffic free side while west van service has remained unaffected @TransLink

@TransLink is the 5:04pm 152 bus from Lougheed Stn cancelled?
@TransLink why are there always half hour to hour long delays with the 156 buses going in either direction?? Kinda sucks waiting out in the cold for a bus that's not even coming
@TransLink no 555 buses so far at Lougheed with massive line forming. Getting mixed with the massive 152 line!
@TransLink maybe someone can use one of these busses sitting here? 
@TransLink increase the bus operation !

@TransLink your app really needs to stop giving inaccurate times of when buses are supposed to be at bus stops. Literally have been waiting for 20 minutes for a bus that comes every 10 minutes.
@TransLink any idea why a bus load of people was dumped at at Keith /grand blvd after already waiting in traffic for over an hour? Operator said she was just doing what the supervisor said &amp; bus was coming. ? 
@TransLink Ok well even texting the stop number and bus is inaccurate too.
"Next is the #AllOnBoard campaign, which many of you know I'm a huge proponent of #bcpoli @TransLink"

@TransLink just wondering how much longer will the modified services be happening for the year :)
@TransLink thanks for the reminder that I can be #OnTimeOrOnTranslink
@TransLink hey. Thanks so much. I have a limp and tried ro walk as fast as I could and your rude bus driver slammed the door on my face. What a joke
@TransLink any info on the 406 bus? Been waiting for 20 mins. 2 buses going the opposite fire tips have passed. I'm at 56756 stop
@TransLink Better be hot cocoa in that bus or I'm throwing a fit
@TransLink how could you have a bus with blackface advertisement? Awful 
"@TransLink soooo, I believe the AC is on in the expo line train to waterfront and it’s extremely cold in here. Car 301. ?"
@TransLink driver of the #7 bus 18377 is missing stops and driving like a maniac
@TransLink why is every 84 bus going to VCC Clark full? 6 in a row passed me.
@TransLink UBC  bus did not stop at bus stop number 51556 535pm  I had to wait 15 minutes for another bus in the cold ?
Need your help with thing. I have totally forgot which bus to take to guilford mall from Surrey central. Can you give me a me the fast route to get there. ? @TransLink
@TransLink is the 601 back to normal now or is it still on it’s detour?
What are your favorite sections along any of the skytrain routes? Here we are cruising into #Surrey from #NewWest. #mytranslink #translink @TransLink @abundanttransit #skytrain #numtot

@TransLink no its okay im just joking akgnakgnsk
"Smells like gingerbread here ? (@ Braid SkyTrain Station - @translink in New Westminster, BC) "
@TransLink No worries! Was just curious. We actually helped our driver when it first started as he had to reroute through our hood before you guys specified beach grove ?
"@TransLink It wasn’t “a bus,” it was 6 in a row. Something definitely went wrong."
@TransLink Where can you catch the 96 at Surrey central tho to go to guilford mall. ?
"Hi there, If the WCE is late at Port Coquitlam is the 159 Braid bus supposed to wait? @TransLink"
@TransLink Thank you.
@TransLink is the 134 Brentwood from Sperling Skytrain Station still coming at 6:20? #58441
@TransLink Thank you just received notification that the 5:40 one was cancelled so I was a tad worry. Though it’s really late notice for those standing here.
@TransLink what’s happening with the 301 from Bridgeport?
"Enjoying a 4-car Mark II (300) on the Evergreen Extension. @TransLink if this is a mistake, I won’t complain. No one is perfect after all. ?"
"@TransLink They're probably gone by now, but just a heads up there was a homeless guy on a bike peeing on the wall of river rock casino right across from Bridgeport Station loop bay 11. Saw it about 40 mins ago"
Just on the skytrain and used the yellow strip to alert skytrain staff cuz an elderly gentleman was smoking inside the train. Glad to see staff arrive right away once the train stopped at Edmonds Station. @translink
It’s great to know that such anonymous safety alert features exist on trains here in Vancouver to ensure passenger safety @TransLink

"@TransLink I know, TODA is a good day for some elevator maintainence."
@TransLink Thanks.
"@tatterededge Glad he left the bus though. 
I usually sit right behind the bus driver and there are so many men (it's never women) get on the bus, no ticket and just look at the bus driver with having no reaction, just ride for free. How is this fair? Annoys the heck out of me. @TransLink"
I’m told this is the responsibility of @BNSFRailway how about doing @CityofVancouver a favour and cleaning it up?
"@TransLink @tatterededge Do appreciate the fact at every bus, every train, it is impossible to have Transit Police there to check everyone has a fare. In years past, have only seen Transit on a bus twice. Too bad, huh? Lots of $'s still lost despite the fare gates, etc."
@TransLink why don’t you guys comply with the time tables? I’ve been waiting for the 153 bus in Coquitlam central and it said it was departing at 9:05 and I’ve been here since 8:50 AND NO BUS SHOWED UP!!!! Be considerate with your users
"@TransLink @tatterededge Maybe a thought would be to have permanent fare checking done at the main transit areas like Waterfront Station, North Vancouver Seabus and bus terminal, Commercial Drive station, since it's where folks may begin their 'FREE TRIP' daily."
"@TransLink S18186 319 9:31 wayover capacity. Take a month or so away from the night bus, not surprised that the drivers are still acting irresponsibly. Buddy turning on the doors before full stop is also a fantastic idea. People slammed to the front windshield. "
TransLink I fucking hate your lack to attention to detail! @TransLink
@TransLink Filed enough of them. Paperwork gets filed under nfg. If it’s valid how about YOU file the paperwork.
WHERE IS THE BUS?!?!?! @TransLink
Get your late night (not even late!!) Burnaby buses together @TransLink  It's Tuesday and it's taken me over an hour to get from Vancouver to North Burnaby and I'm not even at my house yet! #shameonyou #dobetter #translink #youarefailing
@TransLink still fucking waiting. no one is patient. no one knows what's going on. everyone is really fucking annoyed. #yousuck
@TransLink doesn't matter to you because you're already at home. but when it's taken me 90 minutes to get from Vancouver to Burnaby on transit using the train/bus you have failed.

@PixAlert @TransLink congratulations!!
There is no @TransLink #SkyTrain early in the morning. I just had to pay $55 for a taxi ride from @New_Westminster to @yvrairport this morning or I would miss my flight. This is an absolute joke. When will @jjhorgan  @bcndp bring in @Uber @lyft #ridesharing #BritishColumbia ?
"@PixAlert Sounds like a great time but you (and @LuceyFund) need to be congratulating @Translink_NI @TransLink is actually for transit in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Have yourself a great afternoon :) ^CK"
@TransLink oh you vex me. ?.  No 99 B-Line to UBC this morning?  I passed on the 99 - Alma because the UBC bus is always right behind it. So every week there’s a day or two where I have to transfer or there’s no 99 UBC at the regular time. Ugh.
@TransLink Have you extended your M-F hours to 12:30 AM? thats what your web site says
@TransLink FYI the elevator closest to 10th at Commercial/Broadway appears to be broken/haunted 
G' morning @TransLink any chance we will see earlier Seabus times? Perhaps a 5am and 5:30am before the 15min services from 6pm? @GlobalBC @bcpoli

"What is with the gross inconsistency of the 41 Bus leaving Joyce Station this week?? 
1 or none are not operating on schedule. So not cool?
@TransLink"
@TransLink trains are pretty slow this morning eh?
@TransLink Much appreciated. An announcement sooner rather than later would be most welcomed since the workforce certainly has changed and many of us would be grateful for earlier departure times from the North Shore.
"@TransLink @perfectrose2011 It wasn’t about the fare. It was about the swearing &amp; the open beer he was waving around. I handled it, if you read my tweet."
@TransLink @tatterededge I even asked a bus driver once to call either transit police OR his supervisor with 3 drunk men on the 41st Avenue bus at near just 1 pm in the afternoon who were swearing and harassing me. That bus driver did nothing - ignore my request saying he was finishing his shift.
"@TransLink @tatterededge When he got off the bus, 4 stops later at Oak Street (from Cambie) another bus driver was there, I then asked both of them to do something about the 3 drunks still on the bus (I was off the bus to talk to them) and still they both did nothing. I was not impressed &amp; reported this."
@TransLink @tatterededge I was appalled at their inaction and I had done exactly what passengers are told to do. I do not carry a phone most of the time when out; so the suggestion to text or call transit police doesn't work for me. What else would these drunks have had to do to get any response from the
@TransLink @tatterededge bus drivers - as in this particular situation. An entire bus load of folks and not one other person did a thing either. Why should any passenger feel threatened by a passenger and know (as I know now) bus drivers do nothing to help us. I asked repeatedly for them to help.
"@TransLink You would think at a MAJOR station on a YVR link this would be done at night. Just saying most stations have stairs down and an escalator up, therefore, elevators are necessary for many along this #CanadaLine Route"
"@TransLink @tatterededge I was on my way to an appointment near Arbutus and couldn't be late, otherwise I'd have left the bus and caught the next one but it would have made me late. As a paying customer why should drunk, aggressive passengers end up on a bus &amp; me, a paying customer too have to leave it?"
"@BrentToderian Would’ve been interesting if @WestVanDistrict and @TransLink had hired you to make a presentation to WV residents, and to B-Line opponents in particular. I wonder if it might’ve diffused the controversy we’re seeing there now."
"@TransLink so the 501 bus to Surrey Central skipped my bis stop at 72Ave and 200St northbound.

I was told it's a School Special...
I will be late for work because of that."
@TransLink No - the bus managed to find space in front of it to pull up. Seems to happen every Wednesday morning.
@TransLink please turn heat off. Train 021 expo to waterfront
@TransLink Thanks. Have a good day
Hi @TransLink why is it apparently too much to ask that your escalators work on a semi-reliable basis?
?@TransLink? is this my King George Train? Who knows? Because I CAN’T SEE THE SIGN! #tohustleornottohustle You said you would fix it... tick tock!

However, Translink receives $9.8 million in fares.

@thx1979 @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Forgot to mention I don't work for TransLink - haha. I just have a large amount of friends working inside TransLink and ride the bus a lot.
@LienusLateTips @thx1979 @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink any sense of what Translink insiders think of the BLine debacle here in WV?
"@WestVanObserver @thx1979 @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Mostly think it's insanity, as all their studies have shown that bus lanes in #WestVan would reduce travel times for trucks and those sorts of vehicles by adding left turn lanes and reducing the number of cars."
"@WestVanObserver @LienusLateTips @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Good question! 
@mikebuda"
"@LienusLateTips @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink That is fantasy not insanity. I drove it everyday and rely on it for materials deliveries into lower #WestVan 
The lane closures were never going to happen."
"@thx1979 @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Honestly, I believe TransLink. They seem to be really good at traffic studies... Hmmm... I wonder why? Maybe it's because they're a team of engineers who build roads and train lines?"
"@LienusLateTips @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Their model was a joke!
No pedestrians, buses timed all wrong. "
"@LienusLateTips @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Lol their survey was junk

Bureaucratic dumpster fire!"
"@thx1979 @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Even still, that does prove a point. Left turns block traffic on Marine, and adding bus lanes would help fix that by adding left turn lanes."

"@thx1979 @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Yes, and as Burnaby, West Vancouver and Surrey residents paid for our Canada Line, I think I deserve to pay for improvements to North Shore transit."
"@WestVanObserver @thx1979 @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Vancouver a few years ago threw up a ton of temporary signs and duct tape lines on Broadway to test out bus lanes.

@LienusLateTips @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink No they got rid of one in Richmond
@thx1979 @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Yeah... because it was too successful and had to be replaced by a metro line...
"@thx1979 @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Yes, because it was overcrowded from how many people rode it."

"@thx1979 @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink That just proved my point. They axed the 98 B Line in favour of the Canada Line. It's just like if they build a Broadway Subway, how they would axe the 99."
"@thx1979 @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink You do realize that article is a page touting the benefits of bus lanes, right?"
@thx1979 @LienusLateTips @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink I have read there is density paradox. Justification for these sorts of lines depends on assumptions about ridership increases.  I’d guess @TransLink took #WestVan OCP population growth expectations as increase since they assumed there’d be no modal shift betw now and 2035.
"@WestVanObserver @LienusLateTips @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink There is also a construction paradox! How long since Evelyn dr was approved! And population was decreased 2,000 since then."
@LienusLateTips @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink If properly planned they can work. But it was never going to work in West Van. Too few road options.
"@WestVanObserver @thx1979 @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Have you heard the saying ""If you build it, they will come?"" 

It's worked for the Canada Line. The Mayors thought the projections for growth by Richmond City was insane. However, due to the construction, Richmond has actually exceeded those projections."

"@thx1979 @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Yes, just like how the 96 B-Line couldn't work, because there weren't reasonable alternatives to KGB."

"@LienusLateTips @WestVanObserver @CogentthoughtsW @ash_amlani @WestVanRT @NorthShoreNews @TheClosures @TransLink Cars aren’t going away, neither are trucks. 
It’s an urban suburban dichotomy and both things need solutions. Not just transit solutions and funding. North shore needs a vehicle transport solution!"

North van district is limiting to 500 newcomers this year. 
And the Canada line goes to the airport! 
I was tired last night. That was a simply terrible comparison."
@TransLink you need to provide an express bus from Carvolth to a Surrey Skytrain station as you're unable to provide reliable service over the Port Mann &amp; on its West side. Getting access to Skytrains on a south of the Fraser only route would provide somewhat more reliability
@TransLink Any chance we could get long and frequent trains?

Skytrain service is extremely poor. Longer trains that come half as often? Yet they’re all packed! Vancouverites deserve better."

"@PJNewWest @TransLink The traffic study in Connaught Heights. It was really well done consultation with an outcome I disagreed with, but I was heard and recognize that I made points for considration rather than dicatated the outcome."
"@TransLink hey guys, did I see this correctly.  There's more wristbands on sale starting today?"
@mvhra @PJNewWest @TransLink Some residents think it's great and would rather see townhouses and laneway houses instead of unaffordable SFH speculation monstrosities. 2 sides to the coin.
@TransLink 
@PJNewWest @TransLink I'm anxiously awaiting the proposed plans for 1400 Quayside Drive after the open house back in June. That site has such potential and opinions at the open house seemed polarized. Will be interesting to see what pans out there.
"@JustinNTurcotte @PJNewWest @TransLink Oh, absolutely. But, as you know, there are folks out there who don't like change. It's going to be really interesting to see how residents who live in single detached homes embrace infill housing."
@TransLink are there concession wristbands available? I want to grab one for my brother.
"@prag_o_matic @TransLink In context of the original question: are you hoping you disagree with the results because the process was good, or vice-versa?"
"@PJNewWest @TransLink Process has been good—so far. I worry about the city being able to strike a balance that caters to all stakeholders. Personally, I think there’s an opportunity for a unique portion of River Front space that’s geared more toward older kids and adults and I worry that won’t happen."

@TransLink Are there any Compass Card wristbands still available?
@TransLink Thank you!
@TransLink you guys have always been a hit and miss with winter weather but this year you’ve been pretty decent. I’m happy to say though we’re not getting snow for a while. Haha

@TransLink were there two separate police incidents on the westbound #14 on Feb 27? Thx
@TransLink is there a re route for 144 leaving sfu? Reason i am asking is none of the 144s that leave stay on route for the fiest 5 min
@TransLink 15 days???????? Wow seriously the worst system ever.
. @TransLink has re-released the Compass wristband ? 
"@TransLink Every day at New West station, I gotta walk around a crowd to get down the platform, or to get from the train to the exit.
GTFO of the way, people! "
Hey @TransLink some of us who are not able bodied and have difficulties with transportation cannot get access to the compass wristbands all the way out at stadium sky train. Anywhere else we can have access to buy them? Please start thinking about disabled passengers
@TransLink Do buses get to drive in both lanes now? Following this one I'll n Fraser Street riding 2 feet over the white dash line. 
@TransLink Then may I suggest you guys start thinking about people with disabilities in regards to accessing these? It’s not really fair for us that aren’t able to access transportation with difficulty
@TransLink do you guys have the compass wristbands in stock?
@lexsugianto @TransLink Finally I found someone that agrees with me on this

"@baldgrrl @TransLink Thanks, not sure 12 yr old would be keen on wearing that. Translink needs to supply these ... or offer for sale!

@TransLink How near is this train? Platform is full and more people coming and it’s now been another 3 minutes with no train.
@TransLink Two trains have come and both too full to allow people on. I hope a third train will arrive soon
"I am weeping. Someone defaced a @TransLink sign with clear aggression. However it got me thinking, what does NS stand for? Is it North-South in regards for the directions in which Granville runs along? "
@Austin39140404 @TransLink That was because that was likely the time when they had attendants drive the trains. They had less train frequency.
@TransLink Why is the 44 always running 5-10 mins behind. It is supposed to be an express bus but it so useless and unreliable. I’m at stop #58099 ????

@TransLink Arrive at Matthews exchange on its way to cresent beach I mean
@TransLink I saw 3-4 buses go past on the highway so maybe they have been skipping the stop for some reason at that time
@TransLink I was at the stop from 16:16.  Definately skipped the stop so they didn't have to leave the highway which left me and others stranded and waiting for the next one
@TransLink is expo line to waterfront working?
"@TransLink kudos to your 401 bus drivers! It has to be a stressful route given the ongoing construction combined with Richmond traffic, but they're always so friendly and do a great job!"
@TransLink Yeah it's happened twice in a row and has happened previous. I saw 3 buses stay on the highway within the 10 mins between when the 1625 was meant to arrive and when the 1635 did arrive
"@TransLink is it true that Compass wristbands are back, and if so, are there any left?"
@TransLink But I see they are shorter than usual.

@shanna_d88 @TransLink Obviously they are reading it right...just like you.  ?. They need someone on every train when it snows.   That is weak. Minneapolis has a train the goes in the winter.  There I’d understand.functioning at low capacity during the smallest of weather frictions is bad management.
@kyletiney @TransLink It was more like fifteen plus ten times the rider volume.  I also don’t want to add commute time for no reason.  It adds up.  Let’s face it... it’s bad management to have to have an employee on every train when it snows...or in this case when nothing happens.

@TransLink I’ve noticed a lot more city-style (i.e. blue) buses instead of the yellow commuter style on the 351 route of late. Any particular reason for this? More curious than critical.
@TransLink Thanks! What about the 610 388 leaving 22nd street?
@TransLink I love u
@TransLink Thanks. I’ve been riding the buses from South Surrey since 2003. But over the past month I’ve noticed a lot more on the route. For the past six weeks I think all my evening buses home have been the blue ones.
"@TransLink Thanks! This driver is very confused. She drove past the 388 stop, and couldnt figure out where to pick up passengers. We are on our way now."

@kyletiney @TransLink So all the staff and time putting the trains together the night before can be redistributed differently.   It takes a long time and a bunch of staff to 'make the train longer'.   It ends up being a higher cost.  Go check it out.  That is our tax dollars being used.
"@PolitiC77975203 @TransLink And if it snowed 5-10cm last night like it was expected and they weren’t prepared, you would have complained even more.  You’re being extremely petty over a few labour hours to make sure they are adequately prepared to keep the system moving."
@TransLink one of the seabus men’s washroom stalls in Waterfront has blood spattered all over the walls
@kyletiney @TransLink More trains clear the flow and w save money putting staff at the front of the trains that run Regular.  It is a shame that you can’t see how the operation needs help.

.@TransLink A bunch of passengers got left behind at Burrard Station because passengers on board #5 Robson bus (coach 2162 circa 3:30 pm) didn't move all the day to the back to make way for others to board. Seriously. Look at all of the extra room at the back.

Never lane restrictions. Those are West van’s roads. @TransLink
@TransLink waiting at stop # 53035 where is the 189?! was supposed to come at 3:52
@TransLink isn’t there supposed to be a service announcement if there’s a delay?
@TransLink Is there a reason the last 3 183 buses haven’t shown up at Port Moody station?

@TransLink Thank you!!
@TransLink .. hey .. just wondering every time I come to commercial broadway skytrain and want to take 20 Victoria.. everyone has to wait for at least 40 min... today we waited for 1 hour for 20 Victoria... it's not fair ..we pay money for it.. we don't ride free..
"Fir u @translink and @sfu... 
make a deal..."
@TransLink  why do you have a tap in at the back door if the driver doesn't allow you to board from the back.
"Hi @TransLink, I have been charged twice for the $95 one month membership. I have been on hold for over 20 minutes with the customer care line. Can someone give me a call please?"

@TransLink They say Coast mountain bus company on them tho...
"@TransLink Bus 2541 route 20 just now had a horrible driver. Slamming on the brakes, speeding, swerving. Customers were yelling and shouting. Unsafe driving!!!"

"@TransLink whoever is driving the 25 that just stopped at Nanaimo station is a major asshole. multiple break stops causing people to fall, telling at people waiting at a stop and not opening the back doors. horrible."
"For a long haul bus, this one really doesn't score very well in passenger comfort! @TransLink should've ordered better, more comfortable seating for these @novabus_ LFS buses considering the sheer length of these long haul lines they were ordered for. "
"All right @TransLink, I absolutely love this thing "
"@jthornthwaite Ahh, you did actually take @Translink. I think I saw you in @DowntownVan around 9 PM on Seymour near @GothamVancouver walking towards Waterfront? (Unless it was somebody else - you looked distracted/sad.)"
@TransLink I just bought a compass wristband and the paper they gave me missing the CVN number! I need to link the wristband to my iPads account and I can’t do it since it asks for the CVN
@TransLink I did! SUPER RUDE!
"@TransLink I just spoke with two different customer representatives and they were super rude! One of them I asked him to link the wristband to my compass account and he said he did, still it doesn’t appear on the account ."
@TransLink The other told me that it’s not his problem and I have to deal with it with the head office or something! And was blaming me that I didn’t check the paper for the CVN before leaving the office! Like WHAT? Should I do your job guys?
@TransLink I literally don’t even care about the wristband why SO RUDE! give your employees some training before letting them talk to customers and making everything their fault!
"@kyletiney That’s it mince words. You are wrong so attack my character.???.If you do not understand the parallel I drew then just be wrong and move on.The @TransLink is wasting money under bad management and you are too unaware to see it. Bottom line.  I don’t hate anyone, I hate waste."
@TransLink @TransLink hey transit police just removed a drunk passenger at Bridgeport. But he also smacked me in the back of the neck with his cap. While all I can said was we’re at yvr. And he stayed on past it
@TransLink Oh goodness no. It was the drunk passenger who smacked me
@TransLink what a poor service! I am not impressed.... compass card is definitely not working too well
@TransLink ^^
@TransLink No worries. I just wanted to mention if they open a case on him or report and the assault I won’t seek action.

@jerichobreeze @NorthVanRT @TransLink Same situation for me last week. The 246 goes once an hour 7pm and it didn't show so I ended up waiting 2 hours. Sent them a complaint and everything and they didn't care.
"@TransLink @ENieweler @NorthVanRT Complaints do nothing but placate us. Show me proof...

"@TransLink @ENieweler @NorthVanRT Also, the window on this bus (95 SFU, says B16219) is about to fall out. Missing a bunch of screws and it's open to outside. "
@TransLink 29th Ave Station East stationhouse - can't tap in/out at the accessible gate next to the EB track. (This gate mulfunctions so often that going through it feels like a lottery)
"@TransLink The screen stayed green and I heard a weird high-pitch noise, but the gate wouldn't open however I tried to tap in. Another passenger trying to tap out was unsuccessful as well."
@translink is there a reason why the 99 UBC line bus at broadway and penticton (stop 50909) just drove right past the stop around 8:40-42 this morning? App and schedule said it was supposed to come.. this isn’t the first time either
@bett3r @TransLink They're available at the Waterfront WCE office or the stadium Compass customer service centre!

@TransLink bus 323 went by with full sign on but was half empty... and sped by..
@TransLink 55609
@TransLink @jerichobreeze @NorthVanRT You need to get more busses on the 246 schedule. I outlined the entire ordeal that included waiting 2 hours for a bus...seeing ppl get kicked off as it was too crowded to go wait for the 240. Virtually unable to move inside due to crowding. You guys don't care.
@TransLink hey! is it protocol for bus drivers to stop mid-route for coffee breaks? my bus is now 10 minutes behind schedule from my driver pulling over at a cafe.
"@TransLink Yep - it's V9570. I normally wouldn't mind, but the driver had also left the terminal at UBC late due to also going and grabbing a coffee."
@TransLink V9570. The bus driver just pulled over again and is now stopped for a second time at a different cafe.
@TransLink ...as well as stopping about half a block before the actual stop in order to be in front of the cafe.

@TransLink just making sure - the used to be emergency exit at Sapperton is now an actual entrance? Because I came into the station from spruce st using that entrance (and of course I tapped in) but people were giving me dirty looks? Did I do something wrong ?
@604kev @TransLink Oh what?! That’s cool!
@badlands66 @TransLink Christ knows he didn't pay the fare and has likely been napping there for a few hours at least.
@TransLink Maybe add a few signs saying something like “Exit to spruce st” or something so passengers know it’s not an emergency exit anymore

@TransLink screw you for not having an elevator down notice for an elevator down notice for Stadium Chinatown! You never actually care about your mobility impaired riders
@CGWM_Katevatis Aye! West Vancouver isn't a pushover. It's a city dedicated to it's unique needs as a community. Take note politicians and @translink; you're not going to be able to push through your agenda West past the Capilano River unless you have the community aboard
"Yes, residents of International Village are on the hook for maintenance costs of the Keefer Steps, a public thoroughfare, PLUS the disabled access to the Chinatown Skytrain station! @TransLink &amp; @CityofVancouver take advantage of unsuspecting residents."

@TransLink And no I have made it to the Arena but walking from Granville but what would have happened if that was down as it easily can be. You guys forget when an elevator like stadium is down there are no easy fixes in my situation
"@TransLink So get your attendants to check elevator status every 30 mins or something, saying we weren’t aware of it is unacceptable. For some people an elevator being down is the difference between being able to go somewhere or cancelling. I’m fortunate I had enough time to backtrack"
@fernatme @TransLink @CityofVancouver I saw the judgment recently that confirmed they were indeed on the hook. Rather surprising.
"Surprised? This issue has been raised for years, but the City has steadfastly refused to take responsibility this public thoroughfare. Now, Henderson even expects residents to pay his property taxes."

How's that #BadAssBowinn video coming?  Here, use this clip: "
@TransitGeekJoe @TransLink @BowinnMa We have great transportation. Thanks for pointing out you don’t pay any taxes to pay for the 7 billion dollar estimated price tag to take the skytrain from VCC to UBC. That really helps the rest of the region. It’s disgusting!
@CogentthoughtsW @TransitGeekJoe @TransLink @BowinnMa No one cares that she doesn’t pay her taxes or that she lied on her papers. They only care that they get the B-Line past PR. Reminds me a lot of Trump’s “I could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and not lose votes” What happened to character? ?????
"@CogentthoughtsW @TransLink @BowinnMa Yup, I just pay taxes when I visit.  Sales tax, transit fare, embedded tax in the price of things.

Nice to know where you stand on this issue.  I thought at first you just wanted a better route watching one of your YouTubes.  I hope you see as able this:

"
"@TransitGeekJoe Metro town! Lol
That’s Burnaby not West Van or North Van. Burnaby is the second most populous area in Vancity. 
West Van is 43k ppl. 
A unique and affluent community. Think Redmond.
And we pay thousands in property taxes to @TransLink per household per year! 
Carbon taxes also!"
"@TransitGeekJoe @TransLink @BowinnMa That’s peak time! We are getting improvements!
Same councillors words.
#WestVan 
We support the B-line ending at Park Royal. Everyone does.
I’ve never heard stop it in North Vancouver. Please ?? "
"@CogentthoughtsW @TransLink Yup, you sure do pay a ton of tax in @TransLink .  All I'm saying is that visitors - like Bowinn Ma &amp; SeaBus fans - have those taxes embedded when we visit.

If you want the B-Line to stop at Park Royal, OK.  Make that case with class.  It would only shed 3-4 stops. Fine-by-me."
@CogentthoughtsW @TransLink @BowinnMa Long term you will get #SkyTrain too.  Here's Captain Sulu and @CBCStephenQuinn riding SkyTrain: 
"@TransitGeekJoe @TransLink Sweet we agree! 
Everyone West of Park Royal will have to use their local bus anyways. Let’s get THOSE improvements.
Portland built their whole bus expanded system with less than 2 billion. @TransLink wants to spend 7 billion on one itsy bitsy skytrain section. 
@LarsLarsonShow"
"@TransitGeekJoe @TransLink @BowinnMa @CBCStephenQuinn That’s everything ! Lmao !
At what cost! Wow ? 
Is this the let’s go to Mars crowd?"
"@CogentthoughtsW @TransLink @BowinnMa @CBCStephenQuinn Well let's go to Surrey, UBC and eventually the US/CAN border."
@TransitGeekJoe @TransLink @BowinnMa @CBCStephenQuinn At what cost. The wall Trump wants would be cheaper.
@CogentthoughtsW @TransLink @BowinnMa @CBCStephenQuinn Yaaawwwwnnn

@TransLink No 7:04 33 leaving 29th Ave again?
@TransLink This happens all the time on this route
@TransLink The 7:22 showed up before the 7:13. That driver wouldn't let anyone on the bus. Now the 7:13 and another 33 just showed up. So we have no 7:04 33 bit three of them all at 29th Ave now. How does that work?
@TransLink is bus 125 going to show up to stop# 61549? It’s late
"@TransLink , please check out skytrain car 061. There is a whining engine noise when dwelling at stations."

@TransLink Davie and Denman. It’s been like this at least for a month. 20minutes wait during rush hour. We get packed into the first one. And then 1-2 buses arrive after we get off the first one.
"So the bus came at 8:07, which should’ve been 8:09, which is fine, i would just take the next just 7mins behind.                  But, how is this ??? Where is the bus coming at 8:14or 8:16???????????      It finally came at 8:24?????????? Two buses came together?@TransLink "
"The most frustrating thing about commuting via @TransLink buses is when the bus stops and 10+ ppl get off and the “Sorry Bus Full” sign stays on, the driver lets no one on, and just drives off. Can we get some more buses in the #Kits area to handle the volume?"

@TransLink waiting since 9:15..did the 410 from 22nd station scheduled for 9:18 leave too early or how late is it gonna be?
@BCTransit Yes but most transit authorities take advantage of the instant nature of social media (esp Twitter) to communicate route info to customers on the fly. @TransLink does this very well.
@TransLink wheres 9:31 from 59124?
"You bet @BowinnMa , I want to see you win.  Who's coming with me?

FYI this time: @cityjada, @jodyvance, @aBarba, @unspunpodcast, and @CTVVancouver"
@TransLink That tweet is better than the 502 route!
@FEEZYDoesIT @bcndp @TransLink What other statements?  I honestly have not heard any statements from the anti-b-line crowd that aren't at the very least horrifically classist and out of touch.  Most have been laughably dumb.  It's a lot more than 'one' stupid comment.
Riding the @TransLink Skytrain! 
@GradientDragon @TransLink Welcome to the lower mainland
"@martynschmoll That’s just plain false.
The lane closures were not fully disclosed. I’ll believe former Mayor Smith. Nor was the terminus in front an elementary school. Ooops! 
@TransLink"
@TransLink Your new signs aren't telling us what train is passing at Edmonds and half of their intercoms aren't working/announcing where the train is headed so thanks for the #clearCommunication. 
@TransLink question! Why is the normal lafarge skytrain saying its a millennium train to Rupert?
"@TransLink the blonde, female bus driver on bus 9548 driving the 430 to Metrotown right now is the best bus driver ever, so friendly :)"
@TransLink 216
@TransLink I noticed at New Westminster station some cops with dogs sniffing around the tracks and platforms. Is there any need to be concerned?
This was meant for @TransLink and the train has since become unstuck.

"I'm still very bummed that @TransLink is renovating the Granville Station. That escalator is classic Friday The 13th (used in Jason Takes Manhattan). I know they owe us nothing but there should be something celebrating this film. Maybe a plaque?

@theprovince How come if I buy a bus ticket on the bus then try to get on a Skytrain my ticket won’t work @TransLink. Maybe fix your system first
"@Sports_Andy Not all in #WestVan are opposed, you know?  Many of us who can think of the future generation agree with the B-line in principle but I think @TransLink didn’t do a good job presenting the plan as it is, without room for change."
"@TransLink I keep calling the 1-800 compass help number to transfer my pass from my old card to my new, but none of the phone options are helpful. Is there a different number I can call?"

"@TransLink wanna run skytrains past 1:30AM please? ?


#translink #transit "
@TransLink its snowing by new west will there be any delays in the train later today?
@TransLink so I had to unexpectedly take transit today. Unfortunately the compass card I had I didn’t know had no fare on it. I didn’t have the chance either. Obviously couldn’t pay on the bus. So how does this work in these events?

@TransLink is there anything we can do when people follow us thru the gate thereby not paying?

"@TransLink and @CanadaSevens  on Twitter, and tweet the following: (1 entry) Enter for a chance to  win a pair of tickets to watch the #sofancy7s in #Vancouver, courtesy of  @TransLink and @CanadaSevens "
@TransLink @GSVStandback But do they pay it?
"@TransLink How much is it to park your vehicle from 4pm-11pm tonight at the King George and Scott Road Skytrain station parking lot? Wanting to compare, thanks!"
@TransLink @F13thFranchise @clecampdirector Seriously though maybe like a sign or something. Would be cool!
@TransLink @theprovince I understand that you can buy a compass card but in a situation where you do not have one and purchased a bus ticket and you walk up to the Skytrain you have an option of paying twice or sneaking through a gate. I just don’t understand why you haven’t updated your technology yet
@TransLink @theprovince I also understand y you might not immed change all the ticketing tech in buses but y not get a machine at each Skytrain station that exchanges bus tickets for a tapable ticket? Just seems like you should iron out those issues prior to crying the blues about toll jumpers
@TransLink Yeah there's is something ridiculous like $15 or so after a certain time. Thank you so much!
@TransLink Where the hell is the 17 Oak bus?? 3 number 6s have passed on their way back to Davie. A bunch of us have been freezing out here on Nelson for 20 minutes now.

@TransLink Well I was pretty sure there was at least $10 on the card. Not sure how that happened. If I knew there wasn’t of course I would have added more online. That’s what I’m asking. I can’t use my debit card on the bus ????
@TransLink Been waiting at Cap U for a bus for 15 minutes. Massive line up. When is one coming??
@TransLink is 239 park royal/ capliano U experiencing delays?
@TransLink So then in the rare event I just have to take the ride then until I fill it up? I checked too online and my card had the sufficient funds. So I’m at a loss here
"Enter for a chance to win a pair of tickets to watch the #sofancy7s in #Vancouver, courtesy of @TransLink and @CanadaSevens "
"@TransLink No, 239 Bay 5"
@TransLink I'm at capliano university bay 5 :( there are almost 50 students in queue
"@TransLink The bus has now arrived, but was insanely late. Driver admitted it was entirely his fault. Meanwhile I have missed a $70 appointment that I still have to pay for, and book another I can’t afford. Is he going to reimburse me? Is Translink?"
@TransLink You need to send a 239 to bay 5 at Cap u. It’s been 30 min. Huge line of students
. @TransLink why don't you have any alerts listed for the 232? The bus is effectively missing. I get stuff happens but updates would be nice. 
@TransLink Happened to catch some video of the break. Looked very disruptive! Thanks drivers and @TransLink team for keeping ridera moving. ^ms 
"A @TransLink ""Fare Officer"" was clearly having a bad morning. He gave my colleague $346 in fines for borrowing her sister's bus pass to get downtown today. Pretty crazy, penalizing someone *that* amount for using public transportation... A bit harsh? "
POLITE REMINDER.
"@BowinnMa @TransLink OK @BowinnMa , @TransLink ....

How many people you expecting?

What should I and all the #BadAssBowinn superfans all around ze world bring to this transit fan convention?

Also can you please tell everyone there's a #SeaBus that leaves Longsdale Quay every 15 minutes until 9 PM!"
"@bjcjapan @BowinnMa @TransLink @CityOfNorthVan See you there!

So excited for #BadAssBowinn!"
"@TransLink @WestVanDistrict 
How many buses and driver's does it take to finish a route? Apparently more than two. The 227 was supposed to leave at 4:17, it is now 4:35 and neither of them have budged. This is an unacceptable way to treat paying customers. "
@WestVanDistrict @TransLink that number has now increased to three. Absolutely ridiculous. 
@TransLink Yes most of us did. We now wait at phibbs exchange for 239 park royal :(
"@BowinnMa @TransLink I should also add @TransLink there is some really great dining options within a quick walk of @BowinnMa's HQ: 

Plz plug that too.  :-) "
@TransLink hello! how's the 301 from brighouse looking ?
"Enter for a chance to win a pair of tickets to watch the #sofancy7s in #Vancouver, courtesy of @TransLink and @CanadaSevens "
"@TransLink stop 58738, is the 231 not coming? It's very late"
@TransLink couple use a additional entrance fare gate at Vancouver city centre station. Only 2 at the moment and are getting backed up
@TransLink hey! any update on the 418?
"@TransLink Hey! Has the 4:58 pm 501 Langley Centre from Carvolth gone, “Bermuda Triangle”? Two days in a row it has not arrived for a long line of people"
@TransLink Does this mean those of us waiting the other way are hooped? Lines are growing and as usual @TransLink is sucking at communicating this. #strandedbytranslinkagain
@TransLink It’s a pretty major problem when you can’t rely on public transit to be reliable
@TransLink any delays for the Canada Line? Asking for a friend.
@TransLink Stop 60843
@TransLink simple question. Have you cancelled the westbound 9 past commercial?
@TransLink Good thing I didn't bother waiting for you to reply to my tweet about the 231. No reply after 20 mins? Lame.
@TransLink Waiting at boundary loop. When will services resume?
Hey @TransLink have you ever considered upgrading the trolly system for real electric buses??  The technology is real. It'll save you money from the existing trolly line maintenance. #busses #electricbus #electric
@TransLink Ok thanks for replying
@TransLink Why would I want to go to Joyce Station? I was headed west. We really need a public transit alternative that works
"@TransLink I've got a suggestion to make, but instead of a 501 bus from Surrey Central to Carvolth, could you put more 501 from Surrey Central to Langley Centre? Most riders get on through 96ave leading to 200th and then more get added at Carvolth. Most get off past 72nd Ave."
@TransLink Thanks for nothing by the way
@jsrothwell @TransLink  Sometimes stuff doesn't work for a short period of time.
@TransLink how is the 112 looking from New West Station?
@olivercgg @TransLink Just find alternative buses then.  Use Google maps then.
@TransLink huge lineup at granville and goergia Trying to get to ns
@TransLink any updates on the 136 that’s supposed to be at brentwood (61803) ~10mins ago?
@NatalieLanovill @TransLink Or regularly
@TransLink  there are so many buses for park royale on marine but barely buses for Vancouver from North Vancouver....
"I dont know how it can be snowing and the AC’s on @TransLink’s buses would be on the highest. 
Please dears!?"
"@TransLink what's going on with the 240 going North? Been waiting twenty minutes, only one has come, with no room. At Georgia/Granville."
"I have been on public transit for over 2 hours, and much of that was spent stuck in traffic coming from Richmond because I forgot my luggage.
And because @TransLink doesn't provide refunds, I'm losing more money than normal taking transit there and back.

Fuck this bus ride."
"@TransLink  bus 50 - 18322 is "" not full"" sees me, I am waving by hand and he is stopping.. waiting for 25 minutes and snowing, r u going to send a cab to pick me up!!!!as if there is one ..why do we still rely on.. disgrace!!! How do i formally complain?"
"i mean, do i have to wait for it another hour or ???? @TransLink"
"@TransLink puke on the floor on car 317 near door 5, train to King George."
@TransLink What is happening with the #229 / #230? They all aren't on schedule.  The bus is packed.
@TransLink there’s a person that might need an attendant at langara station on the Richmond/YVR platform. They’re sitting on the bench
"@TransLink It’s a daily thing, I see like 5 empty day is ones of the same bus on a lapse on half an hour for Park royale, somewhere you can practically walk too from north van but one packed one of the 240"
"@TransLink I spoke to the driver and she said something about the bus having “climate control” and that the temperature would adjust accordingly, but that never happened. 
430 bus to metrotown. Just alighted at the terminal station."
"@TransLink 61613, 791 eastbound. Bus scheduled for 17:45, still not here."
So frustrated @TransLink - how is it that any Driver of the #236 think it’s a good idea to leave the #SeaBus as an empty bus the very minute the first people are exiting at Lonsdale &amp; making us all wait for another 15+ minutes? 
@TransLink where is the 210?? I’ve been waiting for 40 MINUTES y’all suck
@translink where is the 5:45 228 at Lonsdale Quay? Hasn't shown up.
Literally the exact same thing that happens all the time with @cccta and @SFBART
@TransLink why not just take the 5:59 PM 401 bus off the guide at stop 56425 as it notoriously never shows up.
"@TransLink Just a thought, if the bus is late for that long, shouldn't an alert be sent out?"
"@TransLink @Dale_Bracewell ""Very tight connection"" = too tight for seniors and people with disabilities at the best of times. But it looks fine on TransLink's statistics, which still have little to do with how humanoids experience the system. Transit is complex, and worth doing well."
Hello @TransLink have there been 211 (East bound) cancellations? Been waiting since 5:45.
@TransLink 50078
"@TransLink Yep at 612 so even the 6:11 was late  the 5:59 never shows up, take it off your list"
@bobr818 @TransLink ...no...?  They skate thru on yr dime.
@TransLink @nosliw15 You do for WCE!
@TransLink 50078 (just shared that with the other person) thanks though
@TransLink any updates on 246 or 247. Haven’t seen any in over 45min
@TransLink what's going on at the ubc exchange bay for the 99?
"@TransLink I'm sure you're aware, but you've sent alerts out about delays in the past. "
@TransLink any news why the 16 to 28th Ave station from Renfrew and 1st Ave taking so long?
@TransLink Thanks for the update.
@TransLink 54446
@TransLink It's not the unsual detour... it has to do with an uncovered manhole apparantly
"@TransLink Has the situation changed, still waiting? Thanks"
@TransLink So frustrating Transit day - the 5:46 leaves too early and then neither the 6:05 nor the 6:18 shows up so I’m left paying for another transit fare or finding another way home... 
@TransLink Thanks.
"One question for @BayAreaClipper... Is it possible for disabled visitors from outside the USA to get a temporary RTC card? In my case because of my low vision, I carry a @CNIB card linked to @TransLink's #CompassCard system that I would use in conjunction if I do qualify."
@TransLink I got on th as that one
@TransLink what’s going on at UBC?

"@TransLink I believe there’s construction going on at the bus loop, maybe? I’ve tried to catch the 99 at 3 different spots, but it keeps changing. There are no signs, and no one seems to know where we should go?"
@Translink why is the UBC bus loop closed? Buses are being redirected elsewhere.
"@TransLink @Dale_Bracewell I tweeted the same frustration after getting off the Seabus &amp; seeing the bus drive away, to @TransLink Dale, &amp; was more disappointed that I was advised to then lose more time by filling out a form. Align your connections! Since Kevin Desmond isn’t on Twitter, @selinarobinson FYI."
@TransLink Thanks! It’s the 106 towards Edmonds station; 52450
@TransLink Even here it doesn't say that a bus can run 7 mins late and is considered on time. It should specifically mention that.
@TransLink Provide a list of all timing points on bus 375 Guildford Nd 375 white rock route
"so @TransLink you’ve had ample warning, we’re expecting 3 straight days of snow - are skytrains gonna be prepared this time? not about to be 2 hours late for work over y’all again."
@TransLink @cdjevelina There's a bus blocking the layover area in UBC Exchange rn and it seems like all buses are redirected into the trolley loop. Very poor communications at the moment.
"@TransLink Ok, thanks! ??"
Hey @TransLink there’s a big line at 22nd st station for the 100 Marpole. Been waiting for 30 min or so. What’s up? Lots of people getting annoyed in the snow... 
@TransLink Appreciate it :)
@amoralorealis @TransLink The buses decided that they'd rather go on strike than work in the snow.
@GideonIsmail @TransLink No pls 
@TransLink So there's a bus blocking UBC exchange for some reason and it seems like at least *some* of the buses are being directed down the trolley loop. There're no supervisors at the boarding area of the bus exchange and no detour alerts at all.
@TransLink @CmokJia That construction is supposed to happen *after 12:30 a.m.*. I got confused the first time reading it by the way the alert was set up.
@TransLink where’s the bus driver for 314 #61787. Bus is here and was supposed to have departed 5 minutes ago lol
"@karenhappuch_ @TransLink It means is time for your black Range Rover to drop. God of Nehemiah, please hear your daughter ."
@CmokJia @TransLink True but... 
@amoralorealis @TransLink We both know that the buses here just suddenly decide to stop working whenever they see snow.......................
@TransLink where is 43 Joyce picking up @ UBC?
"@TransLink What aren't detour alerts sent out yet? Even some of your drivers are confused and entering the loop, only to have to turn around inside the bus exchange. People are totally confused out there."
"@TransLink hello,,,,,,,,please"
